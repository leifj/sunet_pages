        <h3>Create a PED Authenticated Legacy-style Application Partition (f/w pre-6.22.0)</h3>
        <p><a name="kanchor41"></a>This section is HSM Application Partition setup for a SafeNet HSM with PED Authentication, where the partition is to remain under the ownership of the HSM Security Officer. 
 The activities in this section are required in two circumstances.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>if you just prepared 
 an HSM  for the first time and must now create your first 
 application Partition, or</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>if you have deleted or 
 zeroized an application Partition and wish to create a new one to replace it. 
 </p>
        <h3>About Application Partitions on the Initialized HSM</h3>
        <p>At this point, the SafeNet HSM should already have its Security Officer 
 assigned. &#160;</p>
        <p>Within the HSM, a separate cryptographic work-space must be created. 
 A workspace, or Partition, and all its contents are protected by encryption 
 derived (in part) from its authentication. Only a User who presents the 
 proper authentication is allowed to see the Partition and to work with 
 its contents. That User (or Crypto Officer and Crypto User) and authentication can be separate from the Security 
 Officer identity, but the application partition is still ultimately owned and administered by the HSM SO, who can modify it at any time.</p>
        <p>In this section, you will:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Create an application Partition 
 </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Set application Partition Policies 
 (Optional)</p>
        <p>These instructions assume that your SafeNet HSM is at a version lower than 6.22.0. The commands available at the SafeNet command line are the traditional ones that have been used with SafeNet HSMs. The outcome of this sequence is the creation of a legacy-style application partition that is owned and managed by the HSM SO and does not have its own independent SO.</p>
        <p>If your HSM firmware is at version 6.22.0 or higher, then some of the commands have changed, and are the same as those listed for creation of a PPSO application partition, in another section of this guide. That is, with the newer firmware you can use the newer commands to create either a legacy-style partition or a PPSO partition. With the pre-6.22.0 firmware, you have only the older commands, and you can create only a legacy partition. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For the following procedure, you must have previously initialized the HSM, and logged into the HSM as HSM SO. </p>
        <p>Having logged in as HSM SO, you can now use the  <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">partition 
 create</span> command, to create an HSM Partition. </p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">You must supply a label 
 or name for the new Partition when you issue the command.</p>
        <p class="code" style="margin-left: 40px;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">lunash:&gt; partition create -partition &lt;name-for-new-Partition&gt;</p>

        <h5>Rules for names and passwords </h5>
        <p>A partition <b>name</b> or a partition <b>label</b> can include any of the following characters : <br /><br />!#$%'()*+,-./0123456789:=@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{}~<br /><br />No spaces, unless you wish to surround the name or label in double quotation marks every time it is used. <br />No question marks, no double quotation marks within the string. &#160;<br />Minimum name or label length is 1 character. Maximum is 32 characters.<br /><br />Valid characters that can be used in a <b>password</b> or in  a cloning <b>domain</b>, when entered via LunaSH [<sup style="color: #ff0000;">1</sup>]), are:<br /><br /> 
&#160;&#160;  !#$%'*+,-./0123456789:=?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{}~<br /><br />(the first character in that list is the space character)
<br /> Invalid or problematic characters, not to be used in passwords or cloning domains are <br />"&amp;';&lt;&gt;\`|() <br /><br />Valid characters that can be used in a <b>password</b> or in  a cloning <b>domain</b>, when entered via <i>lunacm</i>, are:<br /><br /> &#160;!"#$%&amp;\'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
<br /><br />(the first character in that list is the space character)
<br /> <br />Minimum password length is 7 characters; maximum is 255 characters in <i>lunash</i> or <i>lunacm</i>. &#160;<br /><br />Minimum domain string length is 1 character;   maximum domain length is 128 characters via <i>lunash</i>. &#160;No arbitrary maximum domain string length is enforced for domain strings entered via <i>lunacm</i>, and we have successfully input domain strings longer than 1000 characters in testing. &#160;<br /><br />[<sup style="color: #ff0000;">1</sup>] LunaSH on the SafeNet Network HSM has a few input-character restrictions that are not present in LunaCM, run from a client host. It is unlikely that you would ever be able to access, via LunaSH, a partition that received a password or domain via LunaCM, but the conservative approach would be to avoid the few "invalid or problematic characters" generally.<br /><br /></p>

        <h3>Partition creation  audit log entry</h3>
        <p>Each time a partition is created, an entry is added to the audit log. Any subsequent actions logged against the partition are identified by the partition serial number that was generated when the partition was created.</p>
        <h4>Determining the serial number of a created partition from the audit log</h4>
        <p>An audit log entry similar to the following is generated when a partition is created on the HSM:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">5,12/12/17 16:14:14,S/N 150718 session 1 Access 2147483651:2669 SO container operation LUNA_CREATE_CONTAINER returned RC_OK(0x00000000) container=20 (using PIN (entry=LUNA_ENTRY_DATA_AREA))</pre>
        <p>It is not obvious from this entry what the serial number is for the created partition. This information, however, can be derived from the log entry, since the partition serial number is simply a concatenation of the HSM serial number and the partition container number, which are specified in the log entry, as highlighted below:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">5,12/12/17 16:14:14,S/N <span style="color: #f39100;">150718</span> session 1 Access 2147483651:2669 SO container operation LUNA_CREATE_CONTAINER returned RC_OK(0x00000000) container=<span style="color: #f39100;">20</span> (using PIN (entry=LUNA_ENTRY_DATA_AREA))</pre>
        <p>In the example above, the HSM serial number is 150718 and the partition container number is 20. Note that the partition container number is a three-digit number with leading zeros suppressed, so that the actual partition container number is 020. To determine the partition serial number  concatenate the two numbers as follows:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">150718020</pre>
        <p>Use this number to identify the partition in subsequent audit log entiries.</p>
