        <h2>About Configuring Legacy Partitions</h2>
        <p>Before SafeNet HSM release 6.0, an HSM could have one kind of application partition. It was administratively owned by the HSM SO who created it, and was operationally managed by a unified Partition User entity (black PED Key for PED-authenticated HSMs) or by a Crypto Officer and Crypto User (again, the black PED Key for PED-auth HSMs) who simply split the role of Partition User into a role that could create, delete and modify partition objects (the CO), and a role that could use partition objects but not create or change them (the CU).</p>
        <p>SafeNet HSM release 6.0 introduced firmware 6.22.0, along with library updates and new commands and revisions of previously existing commands in the major management tools SafeNet Shell (lunash) for SafeNet Network HSM, and LunaCM for SafeNet USB HSM, SafeNet PCIe HSM, and also for SafeNet Network HSM.</p>
        <p>Now, the possibilities are: </p>

        <p>This section is concerned with the first two types - pre-existing true legacy partitions and newly-created legacy-style partitions.</p>
