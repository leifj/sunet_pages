        <h2><a name="kanchor95"></a>Compare Legacy Partition vs PPSO Partition </h2>
        <p>This page compares the implications and handling of legacy partitions and Per-Partition SO partitions.</p>
        <p>Historically, SafeNet HSMs had a single Security Officer/HSM Administrator (the SO) for the base HSM and for any partitions on that HSM. "Per-Partition SO" (abbreviated PPSO) is an setting that can optionally be applied to HSM partitions to more completely separate the roles. PPSO allows creation of HSM Partitions that individually have a Security Officer administrative role, in addition to the Crypto Officer and Crypto User roles. This makes each such partition behave more like a stand-alone HSM, and is a major step toward full multi-tenancy in cloud environments.</p>
        <p>The possible application partitions that can be viewed and manipulated in the current release include: </p>

 Authenticated HSM <a name="kanchor96"></a><a name="kanchor97"></a><a name="kanchor98"></a>. Activation and autoActivation 
 are ways to manage the additional layer of authentication - the PED 
 and PED Keys - for separate administrative control, so that Clients can reliably connect using just their passwords.</p>
        <h3>Authentication in General</h3>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">SafeNet Network HSM,
 in general, requires authentication from anyone wishing to use the appliance. 
 Access falls into two categories, defined by purpose:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Administrative</span> 
 - you can log in locally via a terminal connected to the serial interface, 
 or remotely via ssh session, to perform administration/maintenance/housekeeping 
 tasks (detailed elsewhere)</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Client</span><a name="kanchor99"></a> 
 - you can connect remotely via ssl to perform "production" activities, 
 using objects and cryptographic functions on an HSM Partition within the 
 HSM ;&#160;administrative/maintenance tasks for PPSO partitions are also performed from a registered client.<br /></p>
        <h4 data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">Administrative</h4>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">To perform any administrative task on the HSM appliance, you must first log in, at 
 the console or via an ssh session, and provide the "admin" password, 
 in order to reach the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">lunash</span> 
 prompt. This is how you access the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">lunash</span> 
 commands. At that first level of authentication and administrative access 
 you can perform some basic, appliance-wide administrative functions (such 
 as configuring or modifying network settings, time setting, handling of 
 logs, updating the system with update packages, etc.) 

 
 that do not involve the HSM or any of the Partitions (virtual 
 HSMs that you might have created within the HSM -- you need to create 
 and assign Partitions if you are to use the HSM appliance in any meaningful way) 

. 
 </p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">Subsets of the lunash command menu require a further level of authentication 
 in order to perform HSM or Partition administrative commands. </p>
        <p>The HSM 
 and Partition commands require the appropriate HSM SO and Partition CO or CU passwords for password-authenticated HSMs, or blue and black and gray PED Keys for PED-authenticated HSMs. See <a href="../ped_keys/ped_keys_and_operational_roles.htm" class="MCXref xref">PED Keys and Operational Roles</a>. &#160;</p>
        <p>When a command is issued to the HSM  that requires HSM or application Partition 
 authentication, the HSM checks for logged-in status and either continues with the operation or issues an error message that the required user is not logged in. When performing the required login operation, a password-authenticated HSM looks for the appropriate password. A PED-authenticated HSM  looks to 
 the connected SafeNet PED. The PED responds by prompting you for actions involving the 
 appropriate PED Keys and the PED keypad. If the PED gets the appropriate 
 response, it confirms the authentication back to the HSM, via the PED interface (the 
 Trusted Path). The required PED Keys would be:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>the blue key(s) needed when 
 the HSM Admin logs in, or issues an <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">hsm</span> 
 command.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>the black key(s), needed 
 when the Partition Owner (or Crypto Officer, if you are working under 
 that model) issues Partition administration commands, or creates, deletes 
 (or otherwise manipulates) non-public objects.</p>
        <p>Those PED Keys (as appropriate), are demanded by SafeNet PED when you perform 
 administrative operations. </p>
        <p>A gray PED Key is just a "black" PED Key with a visible label to differentiate the Crypto User from the Crypto Officer. The PED treats them identically, and prompts only for "black" PED Keys. It is up to you to keep track of who is authenticating - the gray label is meant only to make that easier when handling physical PED Keys. If you prefer (or if you are using pre-existing key-sets), you could have one black PED Key for Crypto Officer, and another black PED Key for Crypto User.</p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">For SafeNet Network HSM, administrative commands arrive via the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">lunash</span> 
 interface (meaning that you must be logged in as the appliance admin first, 
 either at a local, serial console, or via ssh). This applies to the HSM SO for HSM-wide administrative action or for administrative action on legacy partitions, or to the Auditor. For PPSO partitions only creation and deletion are performed via lunash; all other actions (by the Partition SO, CO, and CU) are performed from a client via lunacm.</p>
        <p>The HSM authentication for PED-authenticated HSMs can 
 consist of:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>presenting the required 
 PED Key(s) and pressing [ENTER] on the keypad, or</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>presenting the required 
 PED Key(s), pressing [ENTER], entering a PED PIN (if one had been assigned 
 at initialization) and pressing [ENTER] again.</p>
        <p>Performing the above actions gets you to a login state in which HSM will carry out HSM or Partition commands (according to the level of 
 authentication that you invoked).</p>
        <h4>Authentication and Access Control for Clients</h4>
        <p>However, the point of the HSM appliance is that authorized remote 
 Client applications must be able to access their Partitions, in order 
 to perform useful work (such as signing, verifying, encrypting, decrypting), 
 and also that unauthorized clients be prevented from doing so. Before 
 authorized access can happen, the Partition must be in a logged-in state (as 
 described above) by means of the black PED Key. </p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA"> To preclude access by unauthorized 
 clients/applications, the HSM appliance requires that three authentication 
 conditions be in place:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>The Client and HSM appliance certificates must have been exchanged, and the Client registered to the 
 Partition (during Setup and Configuration). This gives provisional access 
 to the appliance, but not yet to the HSM or any of its Partitions. The 
 Certificate exchange and registration can be initiated by a potential 
 client, but are controlled at the HSM appliance. That is, no potential Client 
 can register without the explicit approval of the HSM appliance administrator.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>The Partition must be 
 readied to accept Client access in a login state authenticated by the 
 black PED Key which is accepted only via the PED (this gives 
 administrative access to the Partition, and opens the Partition to Client 
 access, but only if the next authentication element is supplied), </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>The Client must provide 
 its credentials in the form of an authentication secret (a text-string password).</p>
        <p>The Client authentication is the Partition Password that was displayed 
 by the PED, and recorded by you, at the time the Partition was created (or it is the string to which you changed that original Partition Password, for your convenience, or to fit your security scheme).</p>
        <p>If you provide that Partition Password only to registered, authorized 
 Clients, and if they in turn keep it secret, then no unauthorized client 
 can ever access the HSM appliance or its HSM. If you place an HSM
 Partition into a login state, then any registered application that presents 
 the Partition Password is welcomed as an authorized Client.</p>
        <p>The login state continues as long as a Client has the connection open 
 to the Partition.</p>
        <p>For a password-authenticated HSM, there is only the one secret for the CO, or the one secret for the CU. The client application is given exactly the same partition password that the CO uses, or exactly the same partition password that the CU uses, for administrative purposes, but the client uses it for operational cryptographic purposes.</p>
        <h3>Activation (PED-auth only) &#160;</h3>
        <p>Activation is just a login with explicit caching of the Partition login 
 data, on the HSM. This is convenient so that 
 you can remove the black PED key (perhaps to allow other uses of the 
 PED, such as administrative logins by the HSM Admin), while ensuring that 
 access by Clients is not stopped, and that nobody is required to be present 
 to press [ENTER] on the keypad for the benefit of Client applications. </p>
        <p>To use Activation, you must first allow it by setting Partition Policy 
 22 &#160;(Allow 
 Activation) to <span style="font-style: italic;">on</span>, for each Partition 
 that you create. If the Policy (22, Allow Activation) is on, then the 
 Partition Owner (or Crypto Officer) can activate the partition for use. This is done differently depending upon the HSM firmware.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>for legacy partitions, or any partition on an HSM with firmware older than version 6.22.0, issue the <b>partition&#160;activate</b> command &#160;</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>for PPSO partitions, or any partition on an HSM&#160;with firmware version 6.22.0 or newer, log in as Crypto Officer or Crypto User with the <b>role&#160;login</b> command. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>SafeNet PED prompts for the black PED Key(s) and  PED PIN if appropriate. 
 </p>
        <p>Once you provide it, the HSM  caches that authentication 
 and the Partition remains in a login state (Activated) until:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>you explicitly deactivate 
 (with lunash command <b>partition&#160;deactivate</b>), or</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>you explicitly deactivate 
 (with lunacm command <b>partition&#160;
 deactivate</b>), or</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>power is lost to the 
 HSM.</p>
        <p>With the application partition activated, you can remove the black PED Key and keep it in your pocket or in safe 
 storage. Activation remains on, and any Client with the Partition 
 Password (also known as "challenge secret") is able to connect and perform operations on the Partition.</p>
        <p>Activation is a modest advantage for Clients that connect and maintain an open session. It is  an indispensable advantage in cases where Clients repeatedly 
 connect or open a session to perform a task and then disconnect or close the session.</p>
        <h3>AutoActivation (PED-auth only) &#160; </h3>
        <p>AutoActivation allows automatic re-activation of the Partition, using 
 the cached Partition-Owner/Crypto-Officer authentication data, in the 
 event of a restart or a short power outage (up to 2 hours). That is, the Activated state can recover 
 to allow Clients to re-connect and continue using the Partition, without 
 need for human intervention to insert the black PED Key and press [ENTER] 
 on the PED keypad. </p>
        <p>AutoActivation, which you set by the &#160;<b>partition changePolicy</b> command, requires that Partition Policy 
 23 &#160;(Allow 
 AutoActivation) be <span style="font-style: italic;">on</span>, for the affected
 Partition. </p>
        <p> If the authentication 
 data requires refreshing, then the PED prompts you to insert the appropriate black PED Key and press [ENTER] - that 
 is, a black PED Key that was imprinted with the Partition authentication 
 data for the particular Partition. 

 
  Once control returns to the  command line,
 and a message
 announces success, you can remove the black PED Key and store it away. 
 Client applications can begin  using the HSM Partition. </p>
        <p>We anticipate that most customers will set Partition Policy 23 Allow auto-activation (battery-backed caching of partition authentication) to "On" for their partitions, to ensure the convenience (up-time) of their clients. </p>
        <p>Customers who prefer to not set auto-activation On, but who keep their SafeNet HSMs located remotely from their administrative staff, might prefer to 'manually' resume partition activation by means of Remote PED. These options are entirely a matter of your preference and of your security policy.</p>
