        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>This section provides additional information by answering questions that are frequently asked by our customers.</p>
        <h3>How should SafeNet PED Keys(*) be stored? (*Model iKey 1000 for use with SafeNet PED2)</h3>
        <p>Physically, they are electronic devices, and should be stored in environments that are not subjected to extremes of temperature, humidity, dust, or vibration.</p>
        <p>With that said, PED Keys that have their protective connector-caps in place are quite robust. PED Keys that have their caps on when not immediately in use have survived years of daily use being carried around in office-workers' pockets, here at SafeNet's labs.</p>
        <p>Procedurally, they should be labeled and stored (filed) so that they are readily identifiable according to the HSM(s), the partitions, and the roles with which they have been associated.</p>
        <h3>So I shouldn't keep all the PED Keys for all my SafeNet HSMs in one box in a desk drawer?</h3>
        <p>No. The only place where that might be appropriate is in a test lab where HSMs are constantly re-configured for test purposes, and where they never contain important cryptographic material. PED Keys are just generic iKeys until you make them into specific kinds of PED Key by your administrative actions with SafeNet HSMs and SafeNet PED. Once a blank iKey has been turned into a Security Officer (blue), Domain (red), Partition Owner/Partition User (black), Audit (white), Secure Recovery (purple), or Remote PED (orange) key, you must ensure that it is labeled as such and that you handle it and store it in a way that it can never be mistaken for a different PED Key.</p>
        <p>We have had at least one customer call us in a panic because they had "lost" the SO and Domain and Partition keys to an enterprise-critical HSM. They actually still had those keys, mixed with many others in a box. As you know, SafeNet HSM authentications do not permit a lot of "guessing". For example, you get only three tries to present the correct blue PED Key for HSM SO login, before the HSM contents are lost forever. A customer staffer, new to her job asked: "You make the HSMs and keys, why can't you just give us another one?"  We had to explain that there is no 'back door', ever, to a SafeNet HSM. We (SafeNet) did not make her PED Keys. We made the iKeys, and her predecessor created them as the PED Keys for her organization's HSMs.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, that customer's critical HSMs were in an HA configuration that had not yet synchronized, and the secondary HSM was still in logged-in state.   After trying several red PED Keys it was possible to get a backup of the secondary HSM and restore onto a re-initialized primary HSM.  After that, our responding support engineer spent many hours teaching the customer staffers the basic security and HSM administrative knowledge that had been lost due to staff turn-over at that company. That enterprise customer has since installed rigorous procedures and documentation for handling of HSMs and HSM authentication secrets.</p>
        <h3>I've lost my purple PED&#160;Key. Or, I forgot my PED PIN for my purple PED Key.</h3>
        <p>You are likely in for some cost and disruption, but this is not necessarily a fatal mistake. </p>
        <p>At the present time (this note is written in November 2014) there is no way to recover from a tamper or from Secure Transport Mode if the external split of the Master Tamper Key (the SRK) is not available. If you haven't got a backup purple key, your HSM is locked the moment it experiences a tamper event, or if it was placed in Secure Transport Mode. The same applies if you do have the key, but have forgotten/lost the numeric PED PIN that you applied when the purple key was imprinted with the Secure Recovery Vector (the external split of the MTK). Either way, you must obtain an RMA and return the HSM to SafeNet for re-manufacture. All HSM contents are lost. </p>
        <p>As with every PED Key that you imprint, we recommend that you make at least one backup copy of the purple PED Key, as well. If you can find that valid backup purple key, you can recover the HSM and make a new split, without problem. If the purple key that you lost was the only one... then see the preceding paragraph. </p>
        <p>Note that simply not having the external MTK&#160;split available is not the end of your HSM and its contents. As long as it has not been tampered, or was not  placed into Secure Transport Mode, then the HSM is still working and is perfectly accessible to other key-holders. However, you should immediately back-up all important HSM contents to other HSMs and have SafeNet re-manufacture the affected HSM. When that HSM is returned to you, it will be in one of two states:</p>
        <p>a) it will have both MTK&#160;splits internal (no SRK created), or</p>
        <p>b) it will have a new MTK and a new SRK (purple PED Key) if you requested that we ship the HSM to you in Secure Transport Mode. </p>
        <p>In the first case, you have a "new" working HSM and can decide what you wish to do with respect to SRK - if it is not necessary to your security regime, simply never declare an external split and you will never need to worry about purple keys. Tamper events (if any) will be logged, but will recover automatically when the HSM restarts.</p>
        <p>In the second case, you receive the HSM back from SafeNet, in STM (as requested) and you receive the associated purple key (SRK) by separate courier. You recover the HSM from Secure Transport Mode. At that point, you can elect to disable SRK (return the external split inside the HSM, simultaneously generating a new internal split pair, and invalidating your purple key). OR, you can elect to make a new external split. This imprints a new purple key (SRK) and invalidates the one that we shipped to you. You should make at least one backup copy of the new purple key when it is created, and take better care of your imprinted PED Keys in future.</p>
        <p>Also, if your security regime does not require multi-factor authentication, then see the next question, about PED PINs.</p>
        <h3>Do we really need to include a PED&#160;PIN with each PED Key?</h3>
        <p>Not at all. Or, rather, you do if you already set a PED PIN when you initialized/imprinted that PED Key. But a PED PIN is an optional item when you first initialize an HSM or create a partition, etc. You have the choice, and you don't want to impose a PED PIN requirement on yourself without good reason. </p>
        <p>A PED Key is single-factor physical authentication - "something you have". If that is sufficient to satisfy your organization's security requirements, then you do not need to impose PED PINs. </p>
        <p>You can just press [Enter] on the PED&#160;keypad when the PED Keys are being imprinted (that is just press the [Enter] key with no digits), and you would never be troubled by a PED prompt about PED&#160;PINs again.</p>
        <p>PED PINs are an option - until one is imposed; then it becomes mandatory. Only if your security regime requires two-factor authentication should you consider applying PED PINs to your various PED Keys. Where the physical PED Key is "something you have", the PED PIN is the second factor, the "something you know". A PED&#160;PIN&#160;is a convenient and effective second factor, but it does represent an additional item for you to remember and to track. </p>
        <p>If you lose track - if you fail to remember a PED PIN, or if you have several and don't remember which is which - you can find yourself locked out of your HSM or your HSM partition as surely as if you lost the physical PED Key. More surely, in fact, since you probably have physical backups of your PED Keys (you do, don't you?). Remember, typing a wrong PED PIN on the PED's keypad is the same as offering the wrong physical PED Key to the HSM. It counts as a bad login attempt. PED PINs are good and essential when you need one, but they are not something to impose without a solid security-based requirement. </p>
