        <p>In order to ensure that your data is protected  in the event of a failure or other catastrophic event, <span class="DefaultCompanyName">Gemalto</span> recommends that you adhere to the following best practices as part of a comprehensive backup strategy:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Develop and document a backup and recovery plan. This plan should include the following:</p>

In the event of a local catastrophe, such as a flood or fire, you might lose both your  working HSMs and locally stored backup HSMs. To fully protect against such events, always store a copy of your backups at a remote location. You can automate off-site backups using the remote backup feature, See <a href="remote_app_partition.htm" class="MCXref xref">Remote Application-Partition Backup and Restore Using the Backup HSM</a> for more information.</p>

        <p>The backup operation looks a lot like the restore operation, because they are basically the same event, merely in different directions. </p>
        <h3><a name="How"></a>How Partition Backup Works</h3>
        <p>HSM partition backup securely clones Partition objects
 from a named HSM partition, to a SafeNet Remote Backup HSM (supports remote or local backups) or to a Small Form Factor USB Backup (SafeNet eToken 7300) plugged into a SafeNet PED. This allows you to safely 
 and securely preserve important keys, certificates, etc., away from the primary SafeNet HSM.
 It also allows you to restore the backup device's contents onto more than one HSM partition, 
 if you wish to have multiple partitions with identical contents.</p>
        <p>In order to back up a partition you must own it and be able to see it. This means that you can use LunaSH to back up any partitions you own on a SafeNet Network HSM appliance, or LunaCM to backup any SafeNet PCIe HSM or SafeNet USB HSM or SafeNet Network HSM partitions that are visible as slots.</p>
        <p>When you backup a partition, the contents of your HSM partition are copied to a matching partition on the SafeNet Remote Backup HSM or SFF eToken. You can add to, or replace, objects in the backup archive, as follows:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>partition backups initiated with the <i>add</i>  or <i>append</i> option add new or changed objects to the partition archive, leaving existing objects intact.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>partition backups initiated with the <i>replace</i> option replace all existing objects in the partition archive with current contents of the partition, destroying the existing objects.</p>
        <p>The backup operation can go from a source partition on a SafeNet HSM to an existing partition on the Backup HSM or SFF eToken, or if one does not exist, a new partition can be created during the backup. The restore operation, however, cannot create a target partition on a SafeNet HSM; it must already exist.</p>
        <p>You can restore a partition backup to the original source HSM or to a different SafeNet HSM. The HSM you restore to must already have a suitable partition created for the restored objects. The partition can have any name - it does not need to match the name of the archive partition on the backup device.</p>
        <h4>Backup Devices</h4>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI">You can back up all of your partitions to a SafeNet Remote Backup HSM, or a single partition to a SafeNet eToken 7300 (SFF token):</p>
        <h5 data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI">SafeNet Remote Backup HSM (Backup HSM)</h5>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>The word "Remote" in the product name merely indicates that the SafeNet Remote Backup HSM provides remote backup capability. It also supports local backup and restore. The SafeNet Remote Backup HSM is commonly referred to simply as the Backup HSM.</p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI">The SafeNet Remote Backup HSM (Backup HSM) is a separately powered unit that you can connect as follows:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>to the USB port of a a SafeNet Network HSM appliance. This allows  a SafeNet Network HSM administrator to use LunaSH&#160;to back up any partitions on the appliance that they own (non-PPSO partitions).</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>to the USB port of a local SafeNet HSM client workstation. This allows the workstation administrator to use LunaCM to back up any SafeNet PCIe HSM devices installed in the workstation or any SafeNet Network HSM partitions registered to the workstation.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>to the USB port of a remote SafeNet HSM client workstation running the Remote Backup Service (RBS). You can then register the remote Backup HSM with a local SafeNet HSM client workstation so that the it sees the remote Backup HSM as a slot in LunaCM. This allows the administrator of the local SafeNet HSM client workstation to use LunaCM to back up any local slots  to the remote Backup HSM.</p>
        <h5>SafeNet eToken 7300 (SFF token)</h5>
        <p>The  SafeNet eToken 7300 is a small form factor USB Backup Device that connects to the PED Key port on a SafeNet PED, which connects to the HSM remotely, via Remote PED connection. The Small Form Factor USB Backup is described in <a href="sff/small_form_backup_about.htm" class="MCXref xref">Small Form Factor Backup</a>. SFF backups are supported in LunaCM only.</p>
        <h3><a name="Performi"></a>Performing a Backup</h3>
        <p>To perform a backup, you identify the partition to be backed up (source), and the partition that will be created (or added to) on the Backup HSM or SFF eToken - the Token Partition Name - and then specify whether to <b>add</b> only unique objects (objects that have not previously been saved onto the target partition), or to completely <b>replace</b> the target partition (overwrite it). </p>
        <h4 data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">LunaSH</h4>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">If you are using LunaSH (lunash:&gt;)&#160;on SafeNet Network HSM, the command is:</p><pre xml:space="preserve" data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">lunash:&gt;partition backup -partition &lt;name&gt; -tokenPar &lt;name&gt; [-password &lt;password&gt;] [-tokenPw &lt;password&gt;] [-domain &lt;domain&gt;] [-add] [-replace] [-force]</pre>
        <h4>LunaCM</h4>
        <p>If you are using lunacm:&gt; on a workstation, the command is: </p><pre xml:space="preserve">lunacm:&gt; partition archive backup -slot &lt;slot&gt; -pas &lt;password&gt; -par &lt;backup partition&gt;
or
lunacm:&gt; partition archive backup -slot &lt;etoken&gt; -label &lt;label_for_SFF_token&gt;</pre>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If backing up to an SFF device, you can optionally specify a comma-delimited list of handles for specific objects to backup; otherwise, the default is to backup all objects in the source partition. </p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA,Default.PCI">The  lunacm:&gt; version assumes that the target partition already exists with the appropriate domain, while the lunash:&gt; version expects you to provide the domain, or prompts for it if it is not provided (for Password-authenticated HSMs). </p>
        <h4>Replacing or Appending</h4>
        <p>If a matching target partition exists and the source partition is being incrementally backed up, choosing the <b>add</b> option in the command - then the target partition is not erased. Only source objects with unique IDs are copied to the target (backup) partition, adding them to the objects already there. </p>
        <p>If a matching target partition exists and the source partition is being fully backed up, choosing the <b>replace</b> option in the command. The existing partition is erased and a new one created. </p>
        <h3><a name="Comparis"></a>Comparison of Backup Performance by Medium</h3>
        <p>For reference, this table shows examples of time required for a backup operation for one partition containing 25 RSA 2048-bit keypairs, or 50 objects in total. The source is a SafeNet Network HSM appliance. The destination backup devices and paths are listed in the table.</p>

        <h3><a name="Compatib"></a>Compatibility with Other Devices</h3>
        <p>Backup can co-exist with PKI Bundle operation. That is, multiple devices can be connected simultaneously to a SafeNet appliance (three USB connectors). Thus, you could connect a SafeNet Remote Backup HSM, a SafeNet DOCK 2 (with migration-source tokens in its reader slots), and a SafeNet USB HSM to the three available USB connectors on the SafeNet Network HSM.</p>
        <h3><a name="Why"></a>Why is Backup Optional?</h3>
        <p>In general, a SafeNet HSM or HSM partition is capable of being backed up 
 to a SafeNet Backup HSM or SafeNet Small Form-Factor Backup eToken. The backup capability is considered a good and 
 desirable and necessary thing for keys that carry a high cost to replace, 
 such as Certificate Authority root keys and root certificates. </p>
        <p>However, backup devices are optional equipment for SafeNet HSMs. There are at least three 
 reasons for this:</p>
        <p class="ol1Start" data-mc-autonum="1."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">1.</span></span>Some customers 
 don't care. They may be using (for example) SSL within a controlled boundary 
 like a corporation, where it is not a problem to simply tell all employees 
 to be prepared to trust a new certificate, in the event that the previous 
 one is lost or compromised. In fact it might be company policy to periodically 
 jettison old certificates and distribute fresh ones. Other customers might be using software that manages lost profiles, 
 making it straightforward to resume work with a new key or cert. The certificate 
 authority that issued the certificates would need backup, but the individual 
 customers of that certificate authority would not. In summary, it might not be worthwhile to backup keys that are low-cost 
 (from an implementation point of view) to replace. Keys that carry a high 
 cost to replace should be backed up.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="2."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">2.</span></span>SIM (Secure Identity 
 Management or Multi-Million Keys) does not co-exist with standard SafeNet cloning function. The Scalable Key Storage Master Secret Key on the HSM can be backed up, 
 but HSM Partitions are not used in the Scalable Key Storage configuration, so there are 
 no contents to backup.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="3."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">3.</span></span>Some countries 
 do not permit copying of private keys. If you are subject to such laws, 
 and wish to store encrypted material for later retrieval (perhaps archives 
 of highly sensitive files), then you would use symmetric keys, rather 
 than a private/public keypair, for safe and legal backup.</p>
        <h3><a name="How2"></a><a name="kanchor50"></a><a name="kanchor51"></a>How Long Does Data Last?</h3>
        <p>SafeNet HSMs  have onboard volatile memory meant for 
 temporary data (disappears when power is removed), and onboard flash memory, 
 used to store permanent material, like PKI Root keys, and critical 
 key material, and the firmware that makes the device work.</p>
        <p>No electronic storage is forever. If your SafeNet HSM is operated within an ambient temperature range of 0 degrees Celsius 
 to +40 degrees Celsius, or stored between -20 degrees Celsius and +65 
 degrees Celsius, then (according to industry-standard testing and estimation 
 methods) your data should be retrievable for twenty years from the time 
 that the token was shipped from the factory. This is a conservative estimate, 
 based on worst-case characteristics of the system components.</p>
        <h3><a name="Addition"></a>Additional Operational Questions</h3>
        <h4 data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA"> Is SafeNet Remote Backup HSM capable of backing up multiple SafeNet HSMs or is it a one-to-one relationship? </h4>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA">For example, if we had two SafeNet Network HSM appliances each with two partitions, or if we had four SafeNet PCIe HSMs, could we backup all four partitions to a single Backup HSM? If yes, do they need to be under the same domain?</p>
        <h5 data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA">Answer</h5>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA">One SafeNet Remote Backup HSM can back up multiple SafeNet Enterprise HSMs or SafeNet PCIe HSMs.  The domains on those SafeNet HSMs do not need to match each other (although they can, if desired), since domains can be partition-specific.  The only domains that must match are those on any given SafeNet HSM partition and its backup partition on the SafeNet Remote Backup HSM. With that said, the limits on quantity of backup of partitions from multiple appliances or embedded HSMs is the remaining space available on the Backup HSM, and the remaining number of partitions (base configuration for SafeNet Backup HSM is 20 partitions - you can purchase additional capability).</p>
        <h4 data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA">Can a SafeNet Remote Backup HSM keep multiple backups of a single partition?</h4>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA"> For example, could we perform a backup of an application partition one month and then back it up again next month without overwriting the previous month?</p>
        <h5 data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA">Answer</h5>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.PCI,Default.SA">Yes, you can do this as long as each successive backup partition (target) is given a unique name.</p>
        <h4>Is Small Form Factor USB Backup capable of backing up multiple SafeNet HSMs or partitions? </h4>
        <h5>Answer</h5>
        <p>One Small Form Factor USB Backup device can back up one SafeNet HSM partition. Backup operations are overwrites, not incremental or additive. To use the same Small Form Factor USB Backup device to backup a different HSM partition, you lose any data or objects that were already on the SFF Backup device.</p>
