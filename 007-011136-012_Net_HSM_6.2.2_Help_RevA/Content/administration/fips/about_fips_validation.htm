        <h2><a name="kanchor172"></a><a name="kanchor173"></a><a name="kanchor174"></a>About FIPS Validation</h2>
        <p>In many areas of the information security industry, validations against 
 independent or government standards are considered a desirable or essential 
 attribute of a product. The pre-eminent standard in the field is the FIPS 
 (Federal Information Processing Standards) 140 standard from the United 
 States government's NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology 
 at <a href="http://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.nist.gov</a>).</p>
        <p>SafeNet routinely seeks FIPS validation for our HSM products. We were 
 among the very first to achieve FIPS 140-1 validation for an HSM, and 
 have since re-submitted our products when the standard changed (to 
 140-2) and whenever improvements to our product (or the introduction of 
 new products) introduced enough change that the previous validation did 
 not cover. Since the first, we have never failed to achieve the validation 
 whenever we submit a product or variant.</p>
        <p>In the case of appliance products, such as the SafeNet Network HSM 
  validation is performed against the HSM Keycard inside the appliance, and not against the entire appliance. Furthermore, the validation of the HSM is for a particular firmware version, only. </p>
        <p>However, the process of re-validation, though shorter than a new, first-time 
 validation is nevertheless lengthy and involved. Therefore, whenever we 
 introduce a new product, or a product variant that is sufficiently modified 
 to require a new validation, there is a delay of several months until 
 the validation certificate is granted. </p>
        <p>Also to be considered is that validation can be a moving target. A product that received validation against the standard several years ago might not pass today, not because the standard has changed, but because interpretation has evolved or because testing organizations have revised their emphasis in some areas.</p>
        <p>Finally, older standards give way to newer. Due to the expense and time constraints, companies tend to stay with a previous version of an optional standard until there is sufficient market demand for validation to the newer standard.</p>
        <h3>What does this mean to me?</h3>
        <p>Check with SafeNet to learn the most current validation status of any 
 product, or click the NIST link, above. If FIPS validation is a primary 
 concern for your application, you may need to use a previous, validated 
 version of a product, and forego the latest improvements and features. During the lifetime of a product, we try to ensure that a FIPS-validated version remains available for purchase, despite the existence of newer firmware and hardware versions (see note below).</p>
        <p>If the features of a new release are critical to your application, and 
 FIPS validation is not a gating requirement, then you can use the newest 
 product release. Based on past performance, the most recent release is 
 likely to receive validation within months.</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span> It can happen that external circumstances make it impossible to fulfill the availability policy. An example from our own history was the introduction of the RoHS (Reduction of Hazardous Substances) legislation in the EU. Even where a company retained the capability to manufacture older-version units, they were no longer permitted to sell those older-design products to any country that abides by the RoHS regulations. In other cases, suppliers might no longer have stocked the non-RoHS parts that were used in the older design, and demand might not have justified their creating equivalent parts that meet RoHS standards. In such a situation, we could sell only the newer, RoHS-compliant product, while waiting for it to achieve FIPS (or other) validation. </p>
