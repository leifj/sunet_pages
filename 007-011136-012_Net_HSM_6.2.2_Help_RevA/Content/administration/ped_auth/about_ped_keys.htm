        <h2><a name="kanchor118"></a>About PED Keys</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor119"></a>A PED Key is an electrically-programmed device, with USB interface, 
 embedded in a molded plastic body for ease of handling. Specifically, 
 a PED Key is a SafeNet iKey authentication device model 1000( must 
 be firmware version 1.1 or later - the PED checks the firmware version 
 of a presented iKey, and displays an error message if the version is too 
 old ) 

<a name="kanchor120"></a> 
 with FIPS configuration. In conjunction with  PED 2 or PED 2 Remote, a PED Key can be 
 electronically imprinted with identifying information, which it retains 
 until deliberately changed. </p>
        <p><a name="aanchor0"></a>
            <MadCap:concept term="Luna PED;PED Keys" />A PED Key holds a generated secret that might unlock one or more HSMs. 
 That secret is created by initializing the first HSM. The secret can then 
 be copied (using PED 2.x) to other PED Keys, for purposes of backup, 
 or to allow more than one person to have access to HSMs that are protected 
 by that particular secret. The secret can also be copied to other HSMs 
 (when those HSMs are initialized), so that one HSM secret is able to unlock 
 multiple HSMs.</p>
        <p>The HSM-related secret might be the access control for one or more HSMs, 
 the access control for Partitions within HSMs, or the Domain key that 
 permits secure moving/copying/sharing of secrets among HSMs that share 
 a domain. </p>
        <p>The PED comes in two versions:</p>
        <p>- the standard PED 2 is designed for local connection, only, to a SafeNet HSM</p>
        <p>- the Remote PED 2 has all the function of the standard PED 2 and can also be used remotely from an HSM, when used with PEDServer.exe workstation software.</p>
        <h3>Why do you need PED Keys?</h3>
        <p>The PED and PED Keys are the only means of authenticating, and permitting 
 access to the administrative interface of the PED-authenticated HSM, and are the first part 
 of the two-part Client authentication of the FIPS 140-2 level 
 3 (FIPS 
 is the Federal Information Processing Standards of the United States government's 
 National Institute of Standards and Technology -- FIPS 140-2 is an internationally 
 recognized standard regarding security requirements for cryptographic 
 modules, and level 3 is its second-highest level of security features/assurance) 
 

 
 &#160;compliant 
 SafeNet HSM with Trusted Path Authentication. See <a href="../fips/about_fips_validation.htm" class="MCXref xref">About FIPS Validation</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>The use of PED and PED Keys prevents key-logging exploits on the 
 host HSM, because the authentication information is delivered directly 
 from the hand-held PED into the HSM via the independent, trusted-path 
 interface. You do not type the authentication information at a computer 
 keyboard, and the authentication information does not pass through the 
 internals of the computer, where it could possibly be intercepted by spy 
 software. &#160;</p>
        <p>The PED does not hold the HSM authentication secrets. The PED facilitates 
 the creation and communication of those secrets, but the secrets themselves 
 reside on the portable PED Keys. This means that an imprinted PED Key 
 can be used only with HSMs that share the particular secret, but 
 PEDs are interchangeable (at least, 
 within compatible versions - you can replace any PED 2.x with any 
 other [unless otherwise indicated], but you cannot use a PED 1.x 
 where a 2.x version is needed, or vice-versa) 

.</p>
        <h3>Types of PED Key</h3>
        <p>The current-model PED uses iKey USB-fob type PED Keys of no particular 
 color (the standard issue is black) for all functions. You can visually 
 differentiate your PED Keys by attaching tags or labels. A set of sticky 
 labels in appropriate colors (see below) is supplied with your PED Keys.</p>
        <p>The roles and uses of the PED Keys employed with SafeNet HSMs and the PED 
 are as follows:</p>

 The first actions with a new SafeNet HSM involve creating an SO PIN and imprinting 
 an SO PED Key. The SO identity is used for further administrative actions 
 on the HSMs, such as creating HSM Partition Users and changing passwords, 
 backing up HSM objects, controlling HSM Policy settings. <br /><br />A PED PIN (an additional, optional password typed on the 
 PED keypad) can be added. SO PED

Cloning (secure duplication) of token objects is possible among tokens/HSMs that share a particular domain. Cloning is not possible across different domains, and is not possible where the tokens lack a domain. A domain must be declared and imprinted at the time a token is initialized.</span></a> 
 identifier for any group of HSMs for which key-cloning/backup is 
 to be used. The red PED Key is created/imprinted upon HSM initialization. Another (or could reuse the same domain) is created/imprinted with each HSM 
 Partition. A cloning domain key carries the domain (via PED) to other HSMs or HSM partitions which 
 are to be initialized with the same domain, thus permitting backup and 
 restore among (only) those containers and tokens. The red Domain PED Key 
 receives a domain identifier the first time it is used, at which time 
 a random domain is generated by the HSM and sent to both the red Domain 
 key and the current HSM Partition. Once imprinted, that domain identifier 
 is intended to be permanent on the red Domain PED Key â€“ and on any HSM 
 Partitions or tokens that share its domain. Any future operations with 
 that red Domain PED Key should simply copy that domain onto future HSM 
 Partitions or backup tokens (via PED) so that they may participate 
 in backup and restore operations (see <a href="../ped_keys/what_is_a_domain_ped_key.htm">What 
 is a Domain PED Key?</a> later in this section, for a more detailed explanation). 
 A PED PIN (an additional, optional password typed on the 
 PED keypad) can be added at the time the PED Key is created/imprinted. Red  PED Keys can be <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermglossterm MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_glossterm" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open">duplicated<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>a PED Key can be copied so that two or more PED Keys contain the same secret - this is useful and necessary in order to have backups of each of your PED Keys, and for other operational purposes, but you must maintain rigorous control of all duplicates to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your HSM(s), and for tracking of the "paper trail" of possession, to satisfy your security auditors.</span></a> 
 for backup or multiple copies of the key. </p>
        <p>The red PED Key can be considered the most important PED Key to protect from access by unauthorized persons. An unauthorized person who is able to access the HSM host could see and manipulate objects on a logged-in or activated partition, but would be able to copy those objects to another HSM only if he had possession of the partition domain secret. Without the proper red PED Key, an attacker cannot copy/clone HSM partition contents to other HSMs.              </p>
        <h4>Remote PED  &#160;&#160;</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped/ped-key_remote-ped_orange_small.png" style="border: none;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 14px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 14px;border-style: none;float: left;border-style: none;float: left;" width="90px" height="57px" align="left" border="0" />This PED Key is required when you need to perform PED&#160;operations at a distance. The orange RPK carries the Remote PED&#160;Vector (RPV) and allows a SafeNet PED connected to a properly configured computer to substitute for a PED connected directly to the SafeNet appliance/HSM, when that local connection is not convenient.
</p>
        <p>The RPV is created/imprinted by a SafeNet HSM  with a suitable PED connected (version 2.4.0 or later, having the Remote PED feature installed). A Remote PED can be connected to the USB port of a networked computer that has the PED&#160;driver installed and is running the PEDserver.exe program.
A SafeNet HSM (that has been initialized with a Remote PED&#160;vector) can initiate a secure connection to the Remote PED Server computer, and that connection can be validated by an orange Remote PED Key that carries the same vector as the SafeNet HSM. For the duration of that session, HSM commands can be run at that appliance with all the needed PED Keys (SO, User, Domain, even SRK) being supplied via the PED connected to the computer. There is no need to be present at the remotely located SafeNet appliance/HSM with PED Keys and PED. 
 Orange  PED Keys can be <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermglossterm MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_glossterm" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open">duplicated<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>a PED Key can be copied so that two or more PED Keys contain the same secret - this is useful and necessary in order to have backups of each of your PED Keys, and for other operational purposes, but you must maintain rigorous control of all duplicates to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your HSM(s), and for tracking of the "paper trail" of possession, to satisfy your security auditors.</span></a>

        <h4>Secure Recovery  &#160;&#160;</h4>

The master key is destroyed whenever a tamper event occurs, or when the HSM is deliberately set to Secure Transport Mode. For Secure Transport Mode, the purple PED Key is then shipped via a separate channel from the HSM shipment so that no attacker could obtain access to both the HSM and the SRV while they are in transit. Upon receipt, the administrator brings both the HSM and the purple key together, and invokes the  "hsm srk recover" command. This brings the internal (in the HSM) and external (on the purple SRK) components of the SRV together and recreates the HSM Master Tamper Key, allowing the HSM to be used. 
 <br /><br /> A PED PIN (an additional, optional password typed on the 
 PED keypad) can be added. Purple  PED Keys can be <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermglossterm MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_glossterm" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open">duplicated<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>a PED Key can be copied so that two or more PED Keys contain the same secret - this is useful and necessary in order to have backups of each of your PED Keys, and for other operational purposes, but you must maintain rigorous control of all duplicates to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your HSM(s), and for tracking of the "paper trail" of possession, to satisfy your security auditors.</span></a> 
 for backup or multiple copies of the key, but only during the creation/imprinting of the key - SafeNet PED cannot duplicate purple keys via the standalone PED admin menu. Purple PED Keys are unique to each HSM, and cannot be shared.</p>
        <h4>Audit &#160; &#160;&#160;</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped/ped-key_audit_white_small.png" style="border: none;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 14px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 14px;border-style: none;float: left;border-style: none;float: left;" width="90px" height="57px" align="left" border="0" />Audit is an HSM role that takes care of audit logging, under independent control. The audit role is initialized and imprints a white PED Key, without need for the SO or other role. The Auditor configures and maintains the audit logging feature, determining what HSM activity is logged, as well as other logging parameters, such as rollover period, etc. The purpose of the separate Audit role is to satisfy certain security requirements, while ensuring that no one else - including the HSM SO - can modify the logs or hide any actions on the HSM. The Audit role is optional until initialized. </p>
        <p>A PED PIN (an additional, optional password typed on the 
 PED keypad) can be added. White Audit PED Keys can be <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermglossterm MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_glossterm" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open">duplicated<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>a PED Key can be copied so that two or more PED Keys contain the same secret - this is useful and necessary in order to have backups of each of your PED Keys, and for other operational purposes, but you must maintain rigorous control of all duplicates to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your HSM(s), and for tracking of the "paper trail" of possession, to satisfy your security auditors.</span></a> 
 for backup, and can be shared among HSMs using the "Group 
 PED Key" option.</p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="Default.SA">For SafeNet Network HSM, there is a separate appliance login role (audit) that has access to its own lunash:&gt; commands, in addition to a limited set of view-only commands for the HSM. The  HSM SO and others who log into the appliance as "admin" or as other named roles, do not have access to the lunash:&gt; audit commands.</p>
        <h3>What is a Set of PED Keys?</h3>
        <p>A nominal set of <b>blank</b> PED Keys, as purchased with a SafeNet HSM with PED (Trusted Path) 
 Authentication, consists of ten black USB-token PED Keys, along with colored 
 stickers to identify them (several each of blue, red,  black, orange, white, and purple), 
 which allows some &#160;spares 
 or backups. </p>

            <p>The stickers (above) are just visual labels to attach to your PED Keys. 
 They are provided for your convenience, and you can use them, or not, at 
 your discretion. </p>

            <p>You are not required to have a PED Key of each color, above. The ones that are mandatory for use of your PED-authenticated HSM are the blue SO key, the red domain key, and the black Crypto Officer key. </p>

Imprinting a new secret overwrites (destroys) any HSM authentication secret that was already present on a PED&#160;Key when it was presented for new imprinting. The PED always warns you if the presented key contains an authentication secret. The PED has no way to know if an authentication secret that it finds on a key is useful and valid for some role on the current HSM (or on some other HSM), or if a contained authentication secret is outdated and no longer valid, and therefore safe to overwrite - so the PED&#160;simply tells you what it has found and lets you make the decision. </p>

If you attempt an operation that creates and imprints a new SRK value, the PED will accept any blank key or any non-purple, previously-imprinted PED Key to accept the new external  recovery vector for the currently-connected HSM. That means, it will imprint a new SRV onto any blank key, and it will also imprint a new SRV onto any key that currently contains authentication for SO, CO, CU, Domain, Auditor, RPK, if you tell it to overwrite. <br /><br />But, it will not overwrite a purple PED Key that contains the currently valid SRV for the current HSM. This is a safety feature. <br /><br />Keep in mind that the PED&#160;has no way to determine if a discovered SRV secret on a key is currently valid for some other HSM. It can check only with the currently-connected HSM. </p>

                <br />We recommend that you use some system of visually identifying the role 
 of each PED Key once it is imprinted. Ordinary key-chain tags are handy 
 and can be acquired anywhere; they provide room for written information 
 that is important to you, and they do not interfere with the operation 
 of the PED Keys.</p>
            <p><a name="aanchor1"></a>
                <MadCap:concept term="Luna PED" />We strongly suggest that you use our supplied self-stick PED Key labels, or that you otherwise maintain the color associations that are referenced throughout the documentation and also in the HSM utilities and in SafeNet PED's own dialogs. </p>

        <p>The others are spares for each role. The SO, Domain, and User roles are the minimum that you need to operate the HSM.</p>
        <p>For purposes of backup redundancy, you would normally have at least 
 a second full set for keeping in safe storage, once they have been imprinted. 
 Imprinting takes place when an HSM is initialized (a backup 
 token is initialized/re-initialized whenever a backup is performed onto 
 it)

. 
 Initialization is also an opportunity to make more duplicates of any PED 
 Key, if you require them. Imprinting of Partition PED Keys takes place 
 when an HSM Partition is created (on a SafeNet HSM it is always possible to create at least one Partition -- more 
 may be possible, depending upon the configuration that you initially purchased, 
 or upon licensing/capability update packages that you might later choose 
 to purchase and apply) 

. 
 Again, Partition backup is an opportunity to create more duplicate black 
 PED Keys, or to cause a newly-created Partition to share an authentication 
 secret that is already used on other HSMs' Partitions.</p>
        <p>You will also require additional PED Keys if you decide to use the MofN security feature. </p>
        <p>The numbers of PED Keys that you will need for your situation are discussed in much greater detail at <a href="../ped_keys/how_many_ped-keys_do_i_need.htm" class="MCXref xref">How Many PED Keys Do I Need?</a>.</p>
        <h3>Physical Identification of PED Keys</h3>
        <p>This section is a few suggestions for your handling of PED Keys. Naturally 
 you should be guided primarily by your organization's security policies.</p>
        <p>As indicated above, you might wish to physically mark your PED Keys, 
 in order to help keep track of them. Colored, blank tags are suggested, 
 in addition to the provided stickers, though you could use any identifier 
 that does not interfere with the operation of the PED Key. At a minimum, 
 in an operational environment, you should have at least one working set 
 and one full backup set, and a way to tell them apart. </p>
        <p>If multiple personnel will need access to the HSM, you might provide 
 duplicates of some or all PED Keys that are associated with a particular 
 HSM. It would be helpful to number them, or to write the name or title 
 of the person who will hold each duplicate, to ease tracking. Your organization's 
 security policy might have requirements in that regard.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple HSMs or groups of HSMs in your organization, a 
 thoughtful labeling convention can ease the task of tracking and differentiating 
 the various PED Keys and key-holder personnel.</p>
        <p>If you invoke the optional MofN security feature (see <a href="../ped_keys/mofn_using.htm" class="MCXref xref">Using MofN</a> ), you could have multiple sets of several PED Keys 
 (containing the secret splits for SO, or for the Partition Owner, or for Domain, etc.) that 
 might require unique visible identification. Possibly one person might 
 be the designated holder of MofN secret shares belonging to more than 
 one HSM in your company. If that person is carrying several PED Keys, 
 it would be convenient to see, at a glance, which PED Key belonged to 
 which MofN set so as to avoid making accidental bad login attempts due 
 to mix-ups of PED Keys.</p>
        <p>For example, if each department in your company had a SafeNet HSM, and 
 you were using MofN feature, your key tags might be labeled something 
 like:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped/key-tag_blue.jpg" style="border: none;width: 104px;height: 45px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 12px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 12px;border-style: none;float: left;border-style: none;float: left;" width="104" height="45" align="left" border="0" /><span style="color: #000080;">Accounts Receivable<br />SO #4 of 3of5</span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>So this would be Security Officer (SO) key-share number 4, of a 5-key 
 MofN set that requires at least three key-holders to be present to unlock 
 the administration functions of that HSM in the Accounts Receivable department. You might prefer to not mention the "N" quantity, so that an attacker would not know how many more he/she needed to acquire.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you might use something obscure like:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped/key-tag_blue.jpg" style="border: none;width: 104px;height: 45px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 12px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 12px;border-style: none;float: left;border-style: none;float: left;" width="104" height="45" align="left" border="0" /><span style="color: #000080;">AR4</span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>which could be a code representing a more descriptive entry that you 
 would keep in a log book or in a database. Either way, by looking at the 
 tag you can quickly find out which of various PED Keys you are currently 
 holding.</p>
        <p>Obviously, these are just basic suggestions, and you can use any identifying 
 scheme that works for you.</p>
        <h3>Using PED Keys</h3>
        <p>This is described in detail at <a href="how_to_use_a_ped.htm" class="MCXref xref">How to Use a SafeNet PED</a>. </p>
        <p>Briefly, when you perform an HSM operation that requires a PED Key, 
 you should already have the PED connected to the HSM or appliance.</p>
        <p>When the command is issued, the system tells you when to look to the  PED.</p>
        <p>The PED prompts you when to insert various PED Keys, appropriate 
 to the task. When prompted, insert the indicated PED Key into the connector 
 at the top of the PED, immediately to the right of the PED cable connection, 
 then respond to further instructions on the PED display, until control 
 is returned to the administrative command-line.</p>
