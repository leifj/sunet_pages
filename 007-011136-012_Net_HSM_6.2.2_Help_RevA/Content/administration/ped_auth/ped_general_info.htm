        <h2>Using the PED</h2>
        <p>A SafeNet PED is required  to authenticate to an HSM that requires PED (Trusted 
 Path) Authentication.</p>
        <p>The requirement for Trusted Path Authentication, as opposed to Password 
 Authentication, is part of the specific model of HSM, as configured 
 at the factory (the one exception is the SafeNet Backup HSM, which configures itself, at backup time, as either Password-authenticated or PED-authenticated, depending on the type of primary HSM it is backing up).</p>

        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <h3>Interaction with Other Operations</h3>
        <p>HSM firmware version 6.24.0 introduces a change in how ongoing PED&#160;operations interact with cryptographic operations requested simultaneously.</p>
        <h5>Behavior before HSM&#160;firmware version 6.24.0</h5>
        <p>PED&#160;operations interrupt other operations occuring at the same time on the HSM. The HSM waits for a PED&#160;operation to complete before processing requests for other operations. This can cause delays in production.</p>
        <h5>Behavior after HSM&#160;firmware version 6.24.0</h5>
        <p>PED&#160;operations no longer interrupt other operations occurring at the same time on the HSM in most cases. The most beneficial effect is that PED operations acting on a partition no longer block operations occurring on other partitions on the same HSM. For example, you can now create new partitions or backups while running cryptographic operations on a separate partition. In this way, you can perform maintenance and configuration on your HSM without interrupting important client applications. PED&#160;operations might still block cryptographic operations occurring on the same partition, especially high volumes of write object requests. </p>
        <h3>Versions</h3>
        <p>PEDs 
 are generally unit-interchangeable (with limitations within the version range,  PED 
 2.x, see table), and more specifically interchangeable within the same PED-firmware version. That is, if a SafeNet PED&#160;with a given firmware  supports your current operation with your current HSM version, then any SafeNet PED with the same, or newer, firmware can replace it. </p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>Exception - If you are using the Remote PED feature, only another PED with Remote capability can support that operation, regardless of firmware version.</p>
        <p>Newer PED firmware versions are compatible with HSM versions shown in their row in the table, and backward compatible with any earlier HSM that requires a version 2.x PED.</p>

        <p>PED firmware 2.2.0 is mentioned in the table above because many customers who first bought SafeNet HSM 5.0 were already in possession of older PEDs since they already had earlier SafeNet HSMs (f/w 4.x). SafeNet HSM 5.0 needed PED f/w 2.4.0-3 to access all functions. </p>
        <p>PED firmware 2.5.0-3 or newer is suitable for all local and remote authentication and is required for some PED-mediated features added since SafeNet HSM 5.0.  </p>
        <p>PED firmware 2.6.0-x, available as a field upgrade or on newly-purchased PEDs, supports SafeNet Small Form-Factor Backup - a completely separate function mediated by SafeNet PED, and using different USB tokens - and also supports all previous PED 2.x authentication functions. </p>
        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>In this current discussion, we ignore SFF Backup, and focus on the HSM authentication function of SafeNet PED. The authentication 
 information for your HSM roles is contained on the PED Key, 
 and SafeNet PED is the device that provides the interface so that authentication 
 data can pass between PED Key and HSM (see <a href="about_ped_keys.htm" class="MCXref xref">About PED Keys</a>).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped/hardwarekey.png" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="153px" height="81px" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>The keypad on the PED is used to acknowledge prompts (on the PED&#160;screen) and to optionally input a "something you know" additional secret, called a PED PIN (see <a href="what_is_a_ped_pin.htm" class="MCXref xref">What is a PED PIN?</a>) to augment the "something you have" secret contained in the PED Key.</p>
        <h3>Local and Remote</h3>
        <p>A locally-connected PED is powered by its connection 
 to the HSM. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped_ill/lunaped2_top_mdsm_conn.png" style="border: none;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="297px" height="122px" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>That connection - directly between the PED and 
 the HSM card inside the host - bypasses your computer bus and the 
 computer bus of the HSM host (if separate). It is the only data path between the HSM 
 and the PED and therefore is considered much more secure (trusted) than 
 any authentication path that passes through the appliance's computer data 
 paths. The Trusted Path cannot be monitored by any software (whether authorized 
 by you or not) on your administrative or client computer. Also, because 
 you use the PED Keypad to input the optional PED 
 PIN password (to unlock the secret that, in turn, unlocks your 
 HSM see <a href="what_is_a_ped_pin.htm" class="MCXref xref">What is a PED PIN?</a>), nothing is typed on a computer keyboard. No virus, trojan, spyware, 
 remote-session software or other method can be used to acquire those secrets, 
 because they never pass through the normal computer data pathways, never 
 reside in computer memory or on disk.</p>
        <p>With HSM appliances and host computers  often tucked away in server farms, which are frequently run as "lights-off" facilities with the minimum possible human intervention, the PED cannot always be conveniently connected directly to the HSM. Instead, a callback server arrangement (Remote PED) uses a SafeNet PED connected to a separate computer, at a convenient location, to serve PED interactions over a network connection. The connection is strongly secured and, like the direct connection, prevents unauthorized persons from gaining access to the authentication data. A Remote PED does not have the direct connection to an HSM to provide power; it uses a USB connection for data exchange, which might not provide sufficient stable power for operation. Therefore a PED&#160;used in Remote mode also needs a dedicated power connection via the provided power block.</p>
        <p>For both local and remote PED use, the only way for another person to discover a PED PIN password while 
 you are inputting it is if you allow that person to observe while you use 
 the PED keypad.</p>
        <h3>When Do I Need A PED?</h3>
        <p>You need to use the PED whenever you perform any action with the 
HSM that causes it to look for authentication (with some exceptions, 
 see below). For example, using the shell (lunash on SafeNet Network HSM) or Lunacm (for any SafeNet HSM) you might login as Security 
 Officer, login as User, or initialize the HSM. When the HSM receives such 
 a command, it requests the appropriate data from the PED - or in 
 the case of initialization, the HSM might send data to the PED.</p>
        <p>Therefore, you should have the PED connected and in its ready state 
 ("Awaiting command...") when you issue a command that invokes 
 the PED. One MDSM connector attaches to the matching connector on the 
 HSM or appliance, and the other MDSM (Micro-D Sub-Miniature) connector attaches 
 to its matching connector on the top of the PED (tighten the connector 
 screws if you intend to leave the PED connected; this makes the most reliable 
 connection and provides strain relief to the cable-connector junction 
 during handling of the device).</p>
        <p>If you are using the Activation/autoActivation feature then, after authentication, 
 the data is cached on the HSM, where it remains until you deactivate or 
 you remove power to the HSM. In that case, once the authentication is 
 performed, you can disconnect the PED and store it until the next 
 time it is required.</p>
        <p>If you are not using activation, then authentication data is not 
 cached and every time you or your client application needs access to the 
 HSM, the HSM will look to the PED, which must remain connected. </p>
        <p>For Remote PED connections, the MDSM connector is not used, and power and USB connections are used instead.</p>
        <h3>What Do I Do?</h3>
        <p>As soon as it receives power from a connection 
 to a powered HSM, or from the supplied power block if you are using Remote PED, the  PED performs its start-up and self-test 
 routines and then goes to its normal operating  mode, displaying 
 the prompt "Awaiting command...". &#160;The 
 PED is ready for use in Local mode, by default.</p>
        <p>There are three things that you can do with the PED at this point:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Wait for a prompt, which 
 results when a program has caused the HSM to request authentication</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Change to the Remote Mode (which expects encrypted commands from a computer USB connection, where you would be running Pedserver, rather than from a direct PED-HSM connection) &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Perform standalone PED 
 operations.</p>
        <p>To perform prompted actions, just do what is asked on the PED screen. 
 Normally the prompts are:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Insert a PED Key </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Press "YES", 
 "NO" or "ENTER" on the keypad</p>
        <p>Insert and remove 
 appropriate PED Keys, type numeric passwords (PED PINs) when requested, and so on. The particular 
 sequence depends upon the operation that the HSM needs at the time, which 
 in turn depends on the command-line administrative operations that you 
 are performing (with lunacm, lunadiag, multitoken, or other SafeNet utilities), 
 or operations triggered by your applications.</p>
        <p>

        <h3>Standalone or local or off-line PED operations</h3>
        <p>You can perform some operations on PED Keys without going through the 
 HSM.</p>
        <h5>To perform standalone operations:</h5>
        <p class="ol1Start" data-mc-autonum="1."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">1.</span></span>Press the "&lt;" 
 key to exit from  Local PED mode.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="2."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">2.</span></span>Press "4" to enter Admin mode.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="3."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">3.</span></span>In Admin mode, 
 options are 1 PED Key or 7 Software Update. (The software update function is 
 rarely used and requires that you be sent a PED software file from SafeNet, 
 along with directions about how to use it. Therefore, we'll assume that 
 you are selecting "1 PED Key", which brings the PED to PED Key 
 mode.) <br />Press "1".</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="4."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">4.</span></span>To perform an 
 operation on a particular PED Key, insert that PED Key into the PED Key 
 connector on top of the PED.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="5."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">5.</span></span>PED Key mode 
 has an option "1" to login to that PED Key, which applies to 
 models other than iKey 1000 PED Keys - just press "1" to get 
 to the next menu, if you are using iKey 1000 PED Keys, which do not need login.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="6."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">6.</span></span>At the PED Key 
 Mode menu you have options to Login (which 
 you have just done, but the prompt is available in case you might wish 
 to login to a different PED Key) 

, 
 Logout, or Duplicate the PED Key. Only the "Duplicate" option 
 is meaningful for your iKey 1000 PED Key. To <span style="font-weight: bold;">duplicate</span> 
 the contents of the currently connected  PED Key to another (blank 
 or re-used) PED Key, press "7" on the PED keypad.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="7."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">7.</span></span>When prompted, insert a blank 
 target PED Key, or a non-blank whose data is no longer needed, and press 
 ENTER.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="8."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">8.</span></span>If data already 
 exists on the target PED Key, you are warned and required to press YES 
 two times, to confirm that you really do wish to overwrite whatever is 
 on the PED Key that is currently connected to the PED. <br />If the source PED Key had an optional PED PIN assigned, then that PED 
 PIN is automatically applied to the duplicate during this process.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="9."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">9.</span></span>Remove the newly 
 imprinted PED Key and press ENTER. The PED goes back to "PED Key 
 mode" awaiting further commands. If you wish to duplicate another 
 PED Key, repeat the above steps. Otherwise, press "&lt;" to 
 go back to "Admin mode", and press "&lt;" again to 
 reach the main menu, and finally press "1" to resume "SCP 
 mode", which is the normal operating mode of the PED, awaiting 
 commands from the connected HSM.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="10."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">10.</span></span>Identify the 
 new PED Key with a tag or other marker, and record a PED PIN (if any) 
 in secure fashion, according to your security policies.</p>
        <h3>EXCEPTION: Secure Recovery</h3>
        <p>The PED will not perform a standalone copy operation (that is, without an HSM) of a purple PED Key. This is a security feature. You can copy a purple PED Key (just like any other PED&#160;Key for any other HSM&#160;role or function) during an imprinting operation controlled by a SafeNet HSM. Because purple PED Keys are specific to a single HSM, no other HSM can share a purple key or make a copy. The PED refusal to make standalone copies of purple keys is just an additional barrier to anyone wanting to attack an HSM that has been placed in Secure Transport Mode.</p>
        <h3>EXCEPTION: Remote PED</h3>
        <p>The Remote PED 2 functions as described earlier, when it is in Local or Admin mode. However, when it is placed in Remote mode, it is capable of setting up a secure connection, via a specially-configured computer workstation, to a remotely located HSM. The remote functionality is described separately at <a href="../remote_ped/about_remote_ped.htm" class="MCXref xref">About Remote PED</a>. </p>
