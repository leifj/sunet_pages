        <h2 class="pageBreak">SafeNet PCIe HSM Required Items</h2>
        <p>This section provides a list of the components you should have received with your SafeNet PCIe HSM order. The list of items you should have received depends on whether you ordered a password-authenticated SafeNet PCIe HSM or a PED-authenticated SafeNet PCIe HSM, and whether you order included a backup device, as described in the following sections:</p>
        <h3>Password-Authenticated SafeNet PCIe HSM</h3>
        <p>The following are the standard items that you should have received as your basic order for a password-authenticated SafeNet PCIe HSM:</p>
        <h4>SafeNet PCIe HSM</h4>
        <p>You order should include one SafeNet PCIe HSM 7000 or SafeNet PCIe HSM 1700 HSM. Both HSM models are physically identical.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/pci/pci_card.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Anti-Static Wrist Strap</h4>
        <p>You order should include one anti-static wrist strap. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/install/wrist_strap.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Software and Documentation <span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 18pt; vertical-align: baseline;">*</span>&#160;</h4>
        <p>&#160;<span style="vertical-align: sub; color: #ff0000; font-size: 18pt;">*</span> Software is available by download from Gemalto. Physical media for software and documentation are special-request items. </p>
        <h3>PED-Authenticated SafeNet PCIe HSM</h3>
        <p>For local-only operation, where you work at the same computer that contains your PED-Authenticated SafeNet PCIe HSM, you require at least a single, local-only SafeNet PED2. The standard SafeNet PED 2 is capable of local operation only.</p>
        <p>If you intend to use Remote PED functions, you will need a SafeNet PED&#160;2 (capable of remote or local PED operation).</p>
        <p>If you intend to backup your SafeNet PCIe HSM to a Backup HSM, then you require a SafeNet PED2 to connect to that Backup HSM.</p>
        <p>If you intend to combine remote operation and backup, then you should have at least one remote-capable SafeNet PED2 (for remote connection to the SafeNet PCIe HSM). For convenience you might prefer to have a second PED (which can be local-only for the Backup HSM).  It is possible to use a single Remote-capable SafeNet PED2 for both connections, and to simply change modes (local or remote mode)  as needed.</p>
        <p>The following are the items that you receive when you purchase a standard SafeNet PED2 (local-only capable).</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>You can use SafeNet PEDs and PED Keys that you already own and use with other HSMs – PEDs of the same type and version (v2.3.0 and later) are interchangeable, and PED Keys can be imprinted for use with multiple HSMs if that is appropriate in your context (the only exception is the SRK, which is specific to a single SafeNet PCIe HSM). You should purchase the number you need for your own convenient operation, and for backup/standby units as your security policies might require.</p>
        <h4>SafeNet PED</h4>
        <p>Your order should include a PED 2 device. To use PED-authenticated SafeNet HSM with Remote PED function requires a Remote Capable PED  – the standard PED does not have the Remote capability. They appear almost identical except for a label “PED Remote” on the front, and the availability of the “Remote” menu when powered on.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>SafeNet Local PED  cable</h4>
        <p>Your order should include a 9-pin, Micro-D to Micro-D cable for local PED operation.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/install/cable_micro-d_to_micro-d_local_ped.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>SafeNet Remote PED cable (Remote PED only)</h4>
        <p>If you ordered  a SafeNet remote PED, your order should include a Type A to Mini B USB cable for remote PED operation.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/install/cable_remote_ped.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>SafeNet Remote PED Power Supply Kit (Remote PED only)</h4>
        <p>If you ordered  a SafeNet Remote PED, your order should include a SafeNet Remote PED power supply kit. The power supply is auto-sensing and includes replaceable mains plug modules for international use.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/remote/remote_ped_power_supply.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>PED Keys and Labels</h4>
        <p>Your order should include a set of iKey PED Keys and peel-and-stick labels.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped/ped-key_and_labels.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Backup Device</h3>
        <p>You can back up your selected SafeNet PCIe HSM partition contents (root keys, certificates, other items) to a SafeNet Remote Backup HSM. The SafeNet Remote Backup HSM is a backup-storage option, suitable for off-site storage, and for backing up multiple HSM partitions. The Backup HSM can backup contents of Password authenticated or of PED authenticated HSMs. It must be initialized as one or the other type before the backup operation starts.</p>
        <p>The SafeNet Remote Backup HSM can be connected directly to an HSM, or it can be connected to a separate computer to backup remotely located HSMs, in conjunction with Remote PED.</p>
        <p>The authentication method for external HSMs must match the authentication method for any internally installed HSM with which they are used (password or PED).</p>
        <h4>SafeNet Remote Backup HSM</h4>
        <p>You order may include a SafeNet Remote Backup HSM.</p>
