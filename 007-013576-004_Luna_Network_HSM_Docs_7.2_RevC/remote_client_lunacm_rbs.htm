        </p>
        <h3 class="ntoc"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>
        <p>Remote backups are enabled by the SafeNet Remote Backup Service (RBS). RBS is a utility, included with the SafeNet Luna HSM client software, that  runs as a service (Windows) or daemon (Unix/Linux) on a workstation used to host one or more remote Backup HSMs. </p>
        <p>To use RBS, do the following:</p>
        <p class="ol1Start" data-mc-autonum="1."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">1.</span></span> Configure it to define which of the Backup HSMs connected to the workstation running RBS that you want to make available to other SafeNet Luna HSM client workstations or SafeNet Luna Network HSM appliances for performing remote backups.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="2."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">2.</span></span>Register the workstation running RBS with any SafeNet Luna HSM client workstations or <span class="DefaultProduct">SafeNet Luna Network HSM</span> appliances that you want to be able to use the Remote Backup HSMs.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="3."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">3.</span></span>Start the RBS service/daemon.</p>
        <p>Once RBS is configured and running, the SafeNet Luna HSM client workstations or SafeNet Luna Network HSM appliances registered  with the workstation running RBS can see its available Backup HSMs  as slots in  LunaCM (SafeNet Luna HSM client workstation) or LunaSH&#160;(SafeNet Luna Network HSM appliance). To perform backup and restore operations using the Remote Backup HSMs, you open a LunaCM or LunaSH session, as relevant, on the SafeNet Luna HSM client workstation or SafeNet Luna Network HSM appliance used to host the slot you want to backup, and specify the slot for the Remote Backup HSM as the slot to use for the backup/restore operation.</p>
        <p>The backup operation can go from a source partition (on a SafeNet Luna HSM) to an existing partition on the SafeNet Luna Backup HSM, or if one does not exist, a new partition can be created during the backup. The restore operation cannot create a target partition on a SafeNet Luna Network HSM; it must already exist and have a registered NTLS&#160;link.</p>
        <p>To back up PED-authenticated partitions, you can connect a remote PED to the Backup HSM host workstation, or you can use a separate computer to provide PED operations. </p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6c286b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt; &#160;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span><span style="color: #6c286b;" class="mcFormatColor"> <b>NOTE</b> &#160;&#160;</span></span></span>Remote PED (PED Server) is supported on Windows only.</p>

        <p>The possible configurations for performing a remote backup of a SafeNet Luna HSM client workstation slot are illustrated in the following figures. Only PED-authenticated backup configurations are shown. </p>

        <p>RBS is not a standalone feature. It is a service that facilitates certain scenarios when backing-up HSM partitions or restoring onto those partitions, using a backup HSM that is distant from the primary HSM and its host or client. RBS is run on the computer that hosts the SafeNet Luna Backup HSM, only. RBS is a separate option at software installation time. You do not need it on all client/admin computers, but it doesn't hurt to have it installed. Running RBS also requires running PED Client on that computer, as well as on the distant primary - the paired instances of PED Client form the communications link that makes RBS possible. </p>
        <p>RBS requires PED Client on both the RBS client and RBS server ends. </p>
        <p class="notepad_note">The PEDClient is half of the PEDServer/PEDClient duo that enables Remote PED&#160;service. <br /></p>
        <p class="notepad_note">However, PEDClient is also used in the communication component of Remote Backup Service. So, PEDClient should run on all the platforms that have HSMs - where a SafeNet Luna USB HSM or SafeNet Luna PCIe HSM is installed (PEDClient is already inside SafeNet Luna Network HSM 5.2 and newer...) - and also on any system with the RBS application. <br /></p>
        <p class="notepad_note">The PEDServer is required only on a computer with the SafeNet Remote&#160;PED. <br /></p>
        <p class="notepad_note">If you consolidate your HSM administration (including Remote PED) on the same computer with your SafeNet Remote&#160;Backup&#160;HSM, you would have both PEDClient and PEDServer installed there. We observe that a majority of customers combine administrative functions this way, on a laptop or a workstation that is used to administer one-or-many HSM hosts. The HSM host (with SafeNet Luna USB HSM or SafeNet Luna PCIe HSM) or the SafeNet Luna Network HSM appliance resides in a physically secure, possibly remote location, while the administrator works from a laptop in her/his office. Your security policy determines how you do it. </p>
        <h5>To configure RBS:</h5>
        <p class="ol1Start" data-mc-autonum="1."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">1.</span></span>Install the SafeNet Luna HSM client software on the computer used to manage the HSMs/partitions you want to back up. If you use PED authentication, ensure that the Remote PED option is installed. You must also install the SafeNet Luna Network HSM client software in addition to the SafeNet Luna USB HSM or SafeNet Luna PCIe HSM software, because the SafeNet Luna Network HSM client is the only one that includes the <b>vtl</b> utility, which is required to perform the certificate exchange that enables Remote Backup Service.</p>

        <p>This section describes how to restore an application partition from a remotely located Backup HSM using RBS.</p>
        <h5>To restore an application partition from a remotely located backup HSM:</h5>
        <p>The following procedure provides an example of how to restore a partition from a remotely located Backup HSM. In this example, the partition is restored to a SafeNet Luna Network HSM partition that is not in the activated state. A single remote PED is used to authenticate to the remote Backup HSM&#160;and the SafeNet Luna Network HSM partition. If your primary HSM partition (the partition onto which you will restore the backed-up objects) is in the activated state, then only the Backup HSM needs PED activity for authentication during restore.</p>
        <p class="ol1Start" data-mc-autonum="1."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">1.</span></span>In our test setup, we have each of several SafeNet Luna HSM products. An easy way to see an updated summary of all HSMs and slot assignments is to exit LunaCM and restart the utility.</p><pre xml:space="preserve" class="listLevel1">

        <p class="listLevel1">Because the LunaCM focus rests with the target partition in slot 0, your <b>partition archive restore</b> command must explicitly identify the slot from which backup source objects are to be cloned, slot 3 in this example, onto the target partition, current-slot 0 in this case. You also specified the backup partition name, because a SafeNet Luna Backup HSM can contain more than one archived partition.</p>
