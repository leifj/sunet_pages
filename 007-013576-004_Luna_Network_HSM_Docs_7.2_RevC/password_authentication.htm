        <h2>Password Authentication</h2>
        <p>In general, there are two paths to access the SafeNet appliance and its 
 HSM:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>&gt;</b></span></span>The 
 administrative path, via SSH or via local serial link, which uses 
 the LunaSH 
 command-line interface</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>&gt;</b></span></span>The 
 client path, via SSL, by which client applications use the SafeNet Luna Network HSM API to perform cryptographic functions within pre-assigned virtual 
 HSMs (called partitions) on the SafeNet system</p>
        <p>For SafeNet Luna HSMs with Password Authentication, the various, layered roles are protected 
 by passwords.</p>
        <h4>HSM Admin</h4>
        <p>To access the HSM to perform HSM-specific administration tasks (set HSM-wide 
 policies, update firmware and capabilities, backup and restore the HSM, 
 create and remove HSM Partitions, etc.), you must be logged in to LunaSH as admin, 
 then you must further be logged in as HSM Admin (of which 
 there can be only one per SafeNet Luna HSM). 
 Good security practices suggest that the HSM Admin password should be 
 different from the appliance admin password. However, your corporate policies 
 may differ. As the HSM Admin, you can connect locally, via a serial terminal, 
 or remotely via SSH &#160;– you must 
 first be logged in as admin to have access to LunaSH 
 commands.</p>
        <h4>Partition Owner</h4>
        <p>To access HSM Partitions, in order to perform partition-specific administration 
 tasks (set partition-specific policies, assign Partition to Clients, revoke 
 Clients, etc.), you must be logged in to LunaSH 
 as admin, then you must further be logged in as Partition Owner (of which 
 there can be several - one for each partition in the HSM)
, 
 using the Partition Password. Good security practices suggest that the 
 Partition Password should be different from the appliance admin password, 
 different than the HSM Admin password, and different than other Partition 
 Passwords (for other partitions). However, your corporate policies may 
 differ. As the Partition Owner, you can connect locally, via a serial 
 terminal, or remotely via SSH – 
 you must first be logged in as admin to have access to LunaSH 
 commands.</p>
        <h4>Client</h4>
        <p>To 
 access HSM Partitions with an application to perform cryptographic operations 
 on data, you must connect remotely via SSL (called NTLS in our implementation) as a Client (one 
 that has been registered by certificate exchange and assigned by the Partition 
 Owner to this partition), 
 then pass a User-type (this is done invisibly by your client application), 
 and present the Partition Password (also done automatically by your application). 
 The password used by a Client is the same Partition Password that is used 
 by the Partition Owner for the particular partition. What limits the scope 
 of operations that a registered, authenticated Client can perform on a 
 partition is the fact that partition administrative commands can be issued 
 only via LunaSH. 
 Thus, for security, Clients must not be allowed to learn the appliance 
 admin password that gives access to LunaSH.</p>
        <h3 class="ntoc">Authentication</h3>
        <p> &#160;Objects on the HSM are encrypted by the owner of the HSM Admin space or of the User space (partition), and can be decrypted and accessed only by means of the specific secret (password) imparted by the HSM Admin or the partition User respectively.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0px;">If you cannot present the secret (the password) that encrypted the objects, then the HSM is just a secure storage device to which you have no access, and those objects might as well not exist.</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6c286b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt; &#160;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span><span style="color: #6c286b;" class="mcFormatColor"> <b>NOTE</b> &#160;&#160;</span></span></span>The administrative role secret is also the application-authentication secret: one plain-text secret used for two purposes. On a Password-authenticated HSM, once the administrator (Crypto Officer or Crypto User) has distributed the secret to the application(s), the only way to restrict access by applications (or personnel) that have come into possession of that secret is to change the password - which also changes the authentication for the associated administrative role.</p>
        <h3 class="ntoc">Advantages</h3>
        <p>Using password authentication, as opposed to PED authentication, has the following advantages:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>&gt;</b></span></span>Convenience: changing passwords and authentication secrets is easy in the case of personnel changes or suspected compromise</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>&gt;</b></span></span>Direct mapping to organizational policies: password change policies already existing in an organization are easy to map onto a password authenticated framework</p>
        <h3 class="ntoc">Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>Passwords are less secure than the two-factor authentication provided by the PED, and thus have the following disadvantages:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>&gt;</b></span></span>Vulnerability to observation: passwords being typed can be easily observed in person, through a camera, or with mal-ware like keystroke loggers</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>&gt;</b></span></span>Record-keeping: secure passwords are obscure and must be written, with its record securely stored</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>&gt;</b></span></span>Accountability: it is difficult to know who might have seen or been told a password</p>
