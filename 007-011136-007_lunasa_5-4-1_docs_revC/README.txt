======================================================
Viewing and searching the documentation in HTML format
======================================================
The HTML-format documentation adheres to the HTML5 standard. You can view the
documentation on a Windows, Macintosh or UNIX/Linux computer running Internet
Explorer 8 or later, Firefox 10 or later, Google Chrome 13 or later, and other
browsers that support the HTML5 standard.

The entire documentation suite is available in HTML format. To help ensure
minimal download times, the books are broken into multiple hyperlinked HTML
files, one for each major heading in a chapter.

The HTML Home page includes links to the PDF version of the documents to
facilitate printing or offline viewing of the documentation. 

The HTML documentation is launched automatically when  the DVD is inserted,
provided autorun is enabled. To open the HTML documentation manually, open the
file <dvd_drive>\index.htm.

The user interface components
-----------------------------
The HTML user interface includes a navigation frame, contents frame, and search
frame.

- The navigation frame on the left provides the table of contents. Clicking an
  item displays its contents in the contents frame and/or expands the item to
  show its subtopics. Tabs at the top allow you access the Index or Glossary.

- The frame on the right displays content. When you first access the
  documentation, a splash screen, listing all of the documents in the suite is
  displayed. When you select a topic, the contents of the topic are displayed
  in the content frame.

- The search frame allows you to enter a search term. The search applies to all
  documents in the suite. Results are displayed in the contents frame.

The Home page
-------------------
The HTML documentation home page is displayed when you first access the
documentation in HTML format. The home page provides a brief description of
each of the documents in the suite and provides links to each of the documents
in HTML or PDF formats. Click on the document title to display the first topic
in the document, from which you can access all chapters in the document. Click
on the PDF icon to download the PDF version of the document.

Navigating the table of contents
--------------------------------
You navigate through documents and topics by clicking on the items in the table
of contents. Closed books represent topics that have subtopics. Click on the
book icon to view the subtopics. Once you expand the topic, an open book is
displayed. Click the open book icon to collapse the list of subtopics.

Using the search
----------------
The search function searches all of the documents in the suite.
To perform a search: 
1. Type a search term (or terms) in the Search field. If you type more than one
   term, the search uses an implicit “AND”, that is, it finds the topics that
   contain all of the terms. 
2. Click on the Search button, or press the Return key. The search results are
   displayed.
3. Click on a topic in the search results to display the help for the topic.

=====================================================
Viewing and searching the documentation in PDF format
=====================================================
The entire suite of documents is available in PDF format. You can access the
documents by downloading them from the HTML documentation interface, or you can
access them directly from the documentation DVD or from a network or local
hard drive on which the documents have been installed (see "Installing the
documentation on a hard drive" below). The PDF files are located in the
Contents/PDF_<product> folder.

Clickable links
---------------
All cross-references, index terms, and table of contents entries are clickable
links. With the exception of the index and table of contents, all links are in
purple text. Links to other documents work only when you open the documents in
Acrobat Reader directly off the DVD, or from a copy of the DVD installed
on a hard drive.

Searching
---------
Acrobat provides a basic find function, available in all browsers, which allows
you to find a specific term in the current document. See the Adobe Acrobat help
for more information.
