        <p><a name="kanchor15"></a>For those who need the additional distinction, the Partition Owner role 
 (black PED Key) can optionally be subdivided into two further roles:</p>

        <p>In the past, and continuing, the separation of roles on the  Luna HSM

        <p class="listLevel1">You must be logged in as the appliance "admin" before you can

 Crypto Officer. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">The appliance "admin" performs network administration and some 
 other functions that do not require the additional authentication. Therefore, 
 by controlling access to passwords (for a Luna HSM  with Password Authentication) 
 or to PED Keys (for a Luna HSM  with Trusted Path Authentication), 
 you can compartmentalize the various administrative and security roles. &#160;&#160;</p>

 and a Luna HSM  
 with Trusted Path Authentication have at least two layers of access control 
 for an HSM Partition:<br />- the appliance admin login<br />- the Partition authentication</p>
            <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mc-conditions="Primary.notLunaSP">HSM</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
 with PED (Trusted Path) Authentication</span>, splits the Partition access into 
 two layers. &#160;The 
 HSM Partition Owner (a concept that exists only for a Luna HSM  with PED Authentication) 
 first authenticates to the Partition with the appropriate black PED Key, 
 then activates the Partition for Clients. Thereafter, each Client must 
 further authenticate with the Partition Password (generated by Luna PED 
 when the Partition is created).</p>
            <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mc-conditions="Primary.notLunaSP">HSM</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
 with Password Authentication</span>, the Partition Password is the only 
 layer of authentication to a Partition. Therefore, any Client with that 
 password has access to the Partition. What prevents a Client from manipulating 
 objects on the Partition and performing Partition administration activities 
 is the need to access the lunash command shell. </p>
            <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>Therefore, in both access-control models, a Client with the 
 Password can connect and perform object generation and deletion, and can 
 use objects (sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt), but they cannot perform 
 Partition management operations unless they can also login to Luna Shell 
 (lunash) as admin.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span><b>Client</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p class="listLevel1">A Client is a "working" or "production" user of 
 one or more Luna SA HSM Partitions, that connects from a client computer 
 (one that has set up NTLS by exchanging certificates and registering with 
 the Luna SA). If a Client can provide the Partition Password, it can generate, 
 delete, and use cryptographic objects (keys and certificates) on the Partition, 
 as long as the Partition is prepared to accept the connection. </p>
        <p class="listLevel1">In the case of Luna SA with Password Authentication (assuming the HSM 
 Partition has been previously created with the Password), the appliance 
 simply needs to be powered on.</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">In the case of Luna SA with Trusted Path Authentication (assuming the 
 HSM Partition has been previously created and the Client given the Partition 
 Password), the Partition must also be activated by the Partition Owner. 
 That is, a Client, even with the proper Password cannot access a Luna 
 SA HSM Partition unless that Partition has been placed in "activated" 
 state by the HSM Partition Owner (using the black PED Key).</p>
        <p>That authentication model continues unaffected, for those who prefer 
 it. However an optional, enhanced Cryptoki model is also available, to separate the Partition Owner or Partition User role into a read-write entity and a separate read-only entity:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span><strong>appliance admin</strong> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p class="listLevel1">(Same as appliance admin description above. No change.)</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span><b>HSM Admin</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p class="listLevel1">(Same as HSM Admin description above. No change.)</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span><b>Crypto Officer</b> (full Read-Write access)
 </p>
        <p class="listLevel1">(same capabilities as HSM Partition Owner and Client in the default model)</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">As above for HSM Partition Owner, except that two separate Passwords 
 can now (optionally) be associated with the black PED Key. In both cases, 
 the black PED Key must be presented, and the administrator at the lunash 
 command-line can: </p>
        <p class="ul2" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul2Bullet"><b>–</b></span></span>modify partition policies</p>

 contents &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">The Partition Password is presented when a Client application needs 
 to use the Partition. In this model, there are two Passwords. The Crypto 
 Officer Partition Password allows the Client to perform any crypto-graphic 
 operation, both manipulation (generation, deletion, wrap/unwrap), and 
 use (encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify). &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">The other password is used (along with the black PED Key) for the Crypto 
 User. This is set by the HSM Admin when the Partition is created.</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">In operation, the Crypto Officer would log in at the management interface prompt for 
 Partition maintenance tasks, </p>
        <p class="listLevel1">and/or</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">a Client application could connect to a registered Partition (authenticating 
 with the Crypto Officer Password) in order to generate and manipulate 
 cryptographic objects in the Partition. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span><strong>Crypto User</strong> &#160;&#160;(or restricted 
 Client user - Read-only) &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">If the Partition has been readied for access by the black PED Key, a 
 Client can connect with a Client application, authenticating with the 
 Crypto User Password (a challenge secret, generated on command by the 
 Luna PED, similar to the Crypto Officer or Partition Owner Password that 
 is generated on the Luna PED when a Partition is created). &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">The Crypto User Client can then make use of cryptographic materials 
 already in the Partition (signing, verifying, encrypting, decrypting), 
 but cannot manipulate those objects (no generating or deleting or wrapping/unwrapping). &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="listLevel1">This distinction differs from the old model, with just the one Partition 
 Password, where Client users could not be restricted from generating and 
 deleting keys and certificates. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Either model can be used. If you work in an environment that mandates 
 the Crypto Officer / Crypto User distinction, it is available. If you 
 have no need of the additional password, or if you have legacy applications 
 that use the standard Cryptoki roles, then simply do not activate the 
 Crypto Officer / Crypto User roles.</p>
        <h3>How the Roles are Invoked</h3>
        <p>By default, the Crypto User role does not exist, and so the black PED 
 Key owner is HSM Partition Owner. You create a Crypto User (the restricted 
 Client user) with the "partition createUser" command.</p>
        <h3>Bad Login Attempts</h3>
        <p>By default, both the Crypto Officer and the Crypto user can make 10 
 consecutive failed login attempts before invoking consequences. That is, 
 the two bad-authentication counters are independent of each other. </p>
        <p>Submissions of incorrect Partition Passwords (or Crypto Officer and 
 Crypto User Passwords) are not counted as incorrect black PED Key attempts.</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>The Luna HSM must actually receive some information 
 before it logs a failed attempt, so if you merely forget to insert a PED 
 Key, or provide a wrong-color key, then that is not logged 
 as a failed attempt. When you successfully login, the bad-attempt counter is 
 reset to zero.</p>
