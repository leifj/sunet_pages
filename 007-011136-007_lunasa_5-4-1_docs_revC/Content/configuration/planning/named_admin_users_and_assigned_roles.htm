        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <p>Luna HSM products offer multiple identities, some mandatory, some optional, that you can invoke in different ways to map to roles and functions in your organization. The following topics offer some aspects that you might wish to consider before committing to an HSM configuration. </p>
        <h3>Named Administrative Users and Their Assigned Roles</h3>
        <p>By default, the appliance has </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span> one 'admin' user, with role "admin", always enabled, default password "PASSWORD"</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>one 'operator' user, with role "operator", disabled until you enable, default password "PASSWORD"</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>one 'monitor' user, with role "monitor", disabled until you enable, default password "PASSWORD"</p>
        <p>Those three "built-in" accounts can be neither created nor destroyed, but 'admin' can enable or disable the other two as needed.</p>
        <p>You can leave that arrangement as-is, or you can create additional users with names of your own choice, and assign them any of the roles (and the powers that go with those roles).  The default password of any created user is "PASSWORD" (yes, all uppercase).</p>
        <p>Thus, you could choose to have: </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>multiple admin-level users, each with a different name, </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>multiple operator-level users (or none, if you prefer), again each with a different name, and </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>multiple monitor-level users (or none, if you prefer), each with a different name. </p>
        <p>Administrative users' names can be a single character or as many as 128 characters, chosen from letters a-z, or A-Z, numbers 0-9, the dash, the dot, or the underscore. No spaces.</p>
        <p>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-._</p>
        <p>As with any secure system, no two users (regardless of role) can have the same name.</p>
        <h4>Abilities or Privileges of Created Users</h4>
        <p>Named users empowered with the "admin" role can perform most actions that the original admin can perform.</p>
        <p>User accounts granted the "operator" role have access to a reduced set of administrative commands.</p>
        <p>User accounts granted the "monitor" role can take no actions on the appliance or HSM, and are restricted to commands that view, list or show.</p>
        <p>The commands available to the roles are listed in <a href="../../concepts/user_accounts_and_privileges.htm" class="MCXref xref "><span style="color: #6c286b;" class="mcFormatColor">"User Accounts and Their Privileges"</span></a>.</p>
        <h4>Why Create Extra Administrative Users?</h4>
        <p>One reason for creating multiple named users would be for the purpose of distinguishing individual persons' activities in the logs. </p>
        <p>For example, a user named 'john' running the lunash 'syslog tail' command would show in the April 13 log as:</p>
        <p>Apr 13 14:17:15 172 -lunash: Command: syslog tail  : john : 172.20.10.133/3107
<br />Command Result : 0 (Success)</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have people performing similar functions at physically separate locations, or you might have staff assigned to teams or shifts for 24-hour coverage. It could be valuable (or required by your security auditors) to know and be able to show which specific person performed which actions on the system.</p>
        <p>You might find other uses. Please let us know.</p>
        <h3>Implications of Backup and Restore of User Profiles</h3>
        <p>The commands "sysconf config backup" and "sysconf config restore" allow you to store a snapshot of the administrative user database (the names and status of all named Luna Shell users) that can later be restored if desired. </p>
        <p class="caution" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>CAUTION:</b> &#160;</span></span>
            <br />Restoring from backup restores the database of user profiles that existed before the backup was made. This includes:<br /> - the set of users that existed when the backup was made <br /> - the passwords that users had at the time of the backup &#160;<br /> - the enabled/disabled status of users, at the time of the backup. &#160;&#160;<br /><br />This means that: <br /> - you will lose any user accounts created since the backup, <br /> - passwords of existing users could be reverted without their knowledge, <br /> - enabled users might be disabled (therefor unable to perform their tasks) <br /> - disabled users might be enabled (therefore re-granted access that was suspended) and <br /> - any user accounts removed since that backup will be restored. <br /><br />The first three could be administrative inconveniences. The fourth and fifth outcomes could be serious security issues. &#160;</p>
        <p>Your records should indicate when user-profile changes were made, and what those changes were, so any time that you restore a backup, be sure to reconcile the changed statuses and inform anyone who is affected. For example, users need to know to use their previous password, and to change it immediately.</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>While the "built-in" 'admin', 'operator', and 'monitor' accounts are not deleted or added by a restore operation (those accounts are permanent), both their enabled/disabled status and their passwords are changed to whatever prevailed at the time the backup was originally taken.</p>
        <h3>Security of Shell User Accounts</h3>
        <p>In most cases anticipated by the design and target markets for Luna SA, both the Luna SA appliance and any computers that make network connections for administrative purposes, would reside inside your organization's secure premises, behind well-maintained firewalls. Site-to-site connections would be undertaken via VPN. Therefore, attacks on the shell account(s) would normally not be an issue.</p>
        <p>However, if your application requires placing the Luna appliance in an exposed position (the DMZ and beyond), then please see <a href="../../overview/security_guidance/about_connection_security.htm" class="MCXref xref "><span style="color: #6c286b;" class="mcFormatColor">"About Connection Security"</span></a> in the Overview document for some additional thoughts.</p>
