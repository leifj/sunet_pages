        <h2 class="pageBreak">partition create</h2>
        <p> Create an HSM partition on the HSM. This command creates and initializes a new HSM Partition on the HSM. To use the HSM partition create command you must be logged in to the HSM as HSM Admin (a.k.a. the SO).</p>
        <p>By default, no clients are granted access to a new HSM Partition. The Luna appliance “admin” can run the <b>client assignPartition</b> command to give a registered client access to created HSM Partitions.</p>
        <p>For password-authenticated HSMs, if the password is not provided via the command line, the user is interactively prompted for it. Input is echoed as asterisks, and user is asked for password confirmation.</p>
        <p>For PED-authenticated HSMs, PED action is required, and a Partition Owner PED Key (black) is imprinted. Any password provided at the command line is ignored.</p>
        <p class="caution" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>CAUTION:</b> &#160;</span></span>When labeling HSMs or partitions, never use a numeral as the first, or only, character in the name/label. Token backup commands allow slot-number or label as identifier, which can lead to confusion if the label is a string version of a slot number.<br />For example, if the token is initialized with the label "1" then the user cannot use the label to identify the target for purposes of backup, because VTL parses "1" as signifying the numeric ID of the first slot rather than as a text label for the target in whatever slot it really occupies (the target is unlikely to be in the first slot), so backup fails.</p>
        <h5>Partition and PKI&#160;token naming</h5>
        <p>When creating partitions on the HSM, a check is performed to ensure that the new partition's name is unique (on that HSM). However, this check does not extend to any token HSMs that might be inserted in a connected card-reader slots. Therefore, it is possible to create a partition on the main, onboard HSM that has the same name as a PKI token in one of the reader slots. Avoid this by running the command <b>token pki listdeployed</b>, and checking the output, before invoking the <b>partition create</b> command.</p>
        <h5>Cloning is a repeating atomic action</h5>
        <p>When you call for a cloning operation (such as backup or restore), the source HSM transfers a single object, encrypted with the source domain. The target HSM then decrypts and verifies the received blob.</p>
        <p>If the verification is successful, the object is stored at its destination – the domains are a match. If the verification fails, then the blob is discarded and the target HSM reports the failure. Most likely the domain string or the domain PED Key, that you used when creating the target partition, did not match the domain of the source HSM partition. The source HSM moves to the next item in the object list and attempts to clone again, until the end of the list is reached.</p>
        <p>This means that if you issue a backup command for a source partition containing several objects, but have a mismatch of domains between your source HSM partition and the backup HSM partition, then you will see a separate error message for every object on the source partition as it individually fails verification at the target HSM.</p>
        <h5>Domain Matching and the Default Domain</h5>
        <p>If you do not specify a domain in the command line when creating a partition (<b>partition create</b> command),then you are prompted for it.</p>
        <p>If you type a character string at the prompt, that string becomes the domain for the partition.</p>
        <p>If you simply press [ Enter ] without typing any characters, the system applies, to your partition, the default domain. [ The default domain (Password Authenticated HSMs only) is a string of non-human-readable characters, which is the same for all Luna HSMs. The default domain is useful and easy if you simply wish to engage in cloning (such as backup and restore), and have no concerns about segregating groups of HSMs. If you do wish to have separate groups of HSMs that can clone/backup/restore within groups, but not between groups, you should explicitly set a domain string. ]</p>
        <p>When you run the partition backup command, you are again prompted for a domain for the target partition on the backup HSM. You can specify a string at the command line, or omit the parameter at the command line and specify a string when prompted. Otherwise press [ Enter ] with no string at the prompt to apply the default domain. The domain that you apply to a backup HSM must match the domain on your source HSM partition.</p>
