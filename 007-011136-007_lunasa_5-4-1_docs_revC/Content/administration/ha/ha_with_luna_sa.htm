        <h2><a name="kanchor180"></a>HA with Luna SA</h2>
        <p>This section describes setting up an HA (High Availability) environment 
 with Luna SA.</p>
        <p>For mission-critical applications that require uninterrupted up-time, 
 the Luna SA's High Availability (HA) feature allows multiple Luna SA appliances 
 to be grouped together to form one virtual device. </p>
        <p>In an HA configuration, service is maintained even if one or several 
 physical devices are unavailable. For example, if three Luna SA appliances 
 are combined into an HA Group, service is maintained even if two Luna 
 SA appliances are off-line. Similar to clustering or RAID technologies, 
 the Luna SA HA feature groups two or more Luna SA appliances together 
 to form a single logical unit, as seen from the Client. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ha_overview_cdunn_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When configured for HA, each Luna SA joins an HA Group, managed at the Client. To Clients, 
 the HA Group appears as a single Luna SA. From an operational 
 perspective, the members in the HA Group share the transaction load, synchronize 
 data with each other, and gracefully redistribute the processing capacity 
 in the event of failure in a member machine, to maintain uninterrupted 
 service to Clients. However, all of this HA function is managed on the Client side. Individual HSMs have no awareness that they are part of an HA group. </p>
        <p>Luna SA HA provides load balancing across all Group Members to increase 
 performance and response time while providing the assurance of high-availability 
 service. </p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>All Luna SAs in the HA group are active (rather 
 than one active and the rest passive). Calls are passed from each client 
 application through the Luna SA client-side software (library) to one 
 of the Luna SA appliances in the group on a least-busy basis.<br /></p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span><a name="kanchor181"></a>The Luna SA HA feature provides load-balancing 
 and the safety of redundancy, as well as recovery. See <a href="ha_autorecovery_feature_using.htm" class="MCXref xref "><span style="color: #6c286b;" class="mcFormatColor">"HA Recovery "</span></a> for more details.</p>
        <p>To set up multiple Luna SA appliances in an HA group, follow the instructions 
 in the subsequent pages of this section. You will:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>perform the necessary 
 setup on the Luna SA appliances that you will be including in the HA group 
 <br />- the network setup and naming, <br />- the policy settings needed for HA, <br />- the initialization of the Luna SA appliances into a common cloning 
 domain (same red PED Key for Trusted Path Authentication), <br />- the creation of partitions with matching Passwords across all the 
 Luna SA appliances, and <br />- the recording of Partition serial numbers</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>register your Client(s) 
 with each Partition that will be part of the HA group</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>on your Client, use the 
 vtl utility to configure the HA group and then add the Partitions (on 
 the respective Luna SAs) to that HA group</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>verify your setup, and 
 then point your Client application at the "HSM" 
 (in whatever manner that is usually done in your application) referring 
 to the "HSM" by the HA group label that you assigned. <br />(Normally, 
 your application would likely default to performing cryptographic operations 
 in a software engine, with an option to call a named hardware module or 
 "token", instead -- in this case, you give it the HA group label 
 as the HSM/token identifier, rather than pointing to any specific member 
 of the HA group; the SafeNet library makes the HA operation 
 transparent, and your application appears to be dealing with a single 
 hardware engine.) &#160;

</p>
        <h3>Mix and Match Software Is Not Supported</h3>
        <p>All Luna SA appliances in an HA group must 
 be at the same revision level. If you have Luna SA units at different 
 version levels, perform updates as necessary, before attempting to create 
 an HA group -this applies to the system software version, not to the HSM firmware, which             <b>can</b> differ among group members.</p>
        <h3>Mix and Match Firmware Is Not Recommended</h3>
        <p>Generally, keep all HA&#160;members at the same firmware version. As well, all members should have the same optional capability updates applied. If mismatches are permitted among members, synchronization might be disrupted if your application attempts to use a mechanism or a capability that not all members support.</p>
        <h3>HA Performance</h3>
        <p>For repetitive operations, like a high volume of signings using the same key, an HA&#160;group can expand Luna&#160;SA performance in linear fashion as HA group members are added. HA groups of 16 members have undergone long-term, full-throttle testing, with excellent results. </p>
        <p>Do keep in mind that simply adding more and more Luna&#160;SA appliances to an HA group is not an infallible recipe for endless performance improvement. For best overall performance, all HA group members should be driven near their individual performance "sweet spot", which for Luna&#160;SA 5.2 and later is around 30 simultaneous threads per HSM. If you assemble an HA group that is considerably larger than your server(s) can drive, then you might not achieve full performance from all. </p>
        <p>The best approach is an HA group balanced in size for the capability of the application servers that will be driving the group, and the expected loads - with an additional unit to provide capacity for bursts of traffic and for redundancy. &#160;&#160;</p>

        <h3>Key Generation</h3>
        <p>An application that continuously generates key material will need to have its HA group carefully selected. Contact SafeNet support for help in architecting your HA group for these applications.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>Multi-token is a general-purpose demonstration/exercise 
 tool for Luna HSMs. It is not optimized for all tasks. If you run the 
 extract/insert options (for SIM) in multitoken against Luna SA with several 
 threads against the HA slot, performance appears to be about 10 times 
 slower than in non-HA single slot mode. &#160;<br /><br />The reason is that in this mode multitoken continuously creates 
 session objects that need to be replicated to the additional physical HA slots. 
 &#160;This creates 
  overhead that does not exist in single slot mode. 
 &#160;For optimum 
 real-life performance, your applications should avoid this approach.</p>

        <h3>HA Standby Mode [optional]</h3>
        <p>If your situation requires that some HA group members be active, while others are kept synchronized, but in standby mode, see <a href="ha_standby_optional.htm" class="MCXref xref "><span style="color: #6c286b;" class="mcFormatColor">"HA Standby [optional]"</span></a>. &#160;&#160;</p>
