        <p>In addition to the cardinal admonitions about careful physical security 
 and prompt, thorough backups of your HSM partitions and PED Keys, here 
 are some practical tips to make the tasks as easy as possible.</p>
        <h3>Keep a Log</h3>
        <p>Keep careful records, both of the regular backup procedures, and of 
 who has possession of any token and any PED Key at any time. Your records 
 should show every hand-off or change of possession and your policy should 
 enforce it. Proper security protocols demand that you be able to account 
 for all primary devices (HSM Servers, tokens and PED Keys) at all times, 
 without exception. Establish strict procedures governing when and how 
 those devices may enter storage, be removed from storage, or change hands 
 among users.</p>
        <p>When performing backups and other maintenance functions (such as changing 
 PINs on keys and HSMs), log the event, but also keep a worksheet of notes 
 so that if the task is interrupted you can resume it without confusion 
 or hesitancy as to which devices have been altered and which have not. 
 To help in that regard, see the next section.</p>
        <h3>Apply Meaningful Labels</h3>
        <p>This suggestion has two aspects relating to everyday handling convenience 
 and to the previous section, “Keep a Log”:</p>
        <p class="ol1Start" data-mc-autonum="1."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">1.</span></span>Apply text-string 
 labels to your HSM Servers and tokens.</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="2."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">2.</span></span>Apply physical 
 labels to the exterior of the physical devices.</p>
        <p>In the first case, a unique, easily identifiable word or phrase serves 
 as a final check in <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">lunash</span> 
 or at the client when you are about to perform an action that could alter 
 an HSM, a token or its contents. You might consider a label consisting 
 of a part (perhaps a word) that identifies the domain to which the token 
 belongs, and another part (perhaps another word or a number) that identifies 
 it as a particular member of that group. &#160;</p>
        <p>The second case, physical labels, applies to HSM Servers and PED Keys.</p>
        <p>When handling multiple HSMs and keys, it is easily possible to become 
 confused as to which ones have been updated and which ones are yet to 
 be updated. Worse (if you are using common administrative group PED Keys) 
 would be restoring onto the wrong Partition or HSM Server, from a backup. 
 </p>
        <p>General physical handling is made easier if you have a way to identify 
 a device visually. Easy identification facilitates log-keeping.</p>
        <p>Do not cover or obstruct the connector end of a PED Key.</p>
        <p>Do not permanently obscure the appliance serial number. You would want 
 it visible in the unlikely event that you ever needed to contact SafeNet 
 for assistance.</p>
        <h3>Keys</h3>
        <p>PED Keys have different roles.  Colors help to easily distinguish the roles and you should use the labels included with the product (blue, red, black, orange, and purple) to mark PED Keys before you initialize them. The additional suggestions on this page are about applying <i>additional</i> labels (stickers, tags, other) of your own, to identify specific keys and key sets and where they fit in your operational scheme.</p>
        <p>The PED Keys might further be in need of visual identifiers 
 if you elect the M of N option, which adds several, visually-similar keys 
 to the mix. It might be useful to identify the following:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Which keys (blue, black, 
 red) are associated with which HSMs or Partitions or Clusters).</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Which black keys are 
 associated with which Partition and client. It normally makes sense to 
 associate a key to a title or function, rather than to a specific person.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Which key is which in 
 an M of N group. This is particularly useful when the SO is initializing 
 HSMs and keys (and could be accomplished by temporary labels in that situation). 
 </p>
        <p>You must decide whether visual identifiers of M of N status of keys 
 would be useful once the keys and tokens are in operation (or in backup 
 safe storage), or whether your security requirements would prohibit such 
 tags or markings.</p>
