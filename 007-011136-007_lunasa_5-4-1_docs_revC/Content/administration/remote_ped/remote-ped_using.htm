        <h2>Using the Remote PED Feature</h2>
        <p>To use Remote PED for the first time, you will need:</p>
        <p> - a Luna  PED 2.5.0-2 (or later) with Remote PED feature installed (the SafeNet label on the back has the words "REMOTE PED CAPABLE", top center, between the SafeNet logo and the FCC declaration)</p>
        <p>- a power adapter for the Remote PED (when the PED&#160;is not connected to a Luna SA, via the PED port, it requires the separate power adapter to supply its power - the USB connection is insufficient for that purpose)</p>
        <p>- a complete set of PED Keys, including an orange Remote PED key (either new/empty or already containing a Remote PED vector)</p>
        <p>- local access to the Luna SA (for the first session only)</p>
        <p>- HSM/appliance that supports the Remote PED&#160;feature (includes the Remote PED Client)</p>
        <p>- a workstation/PC with the PEDserver.exe (Remote PED&#160;Server application) running, and with the appropriate PED driver already installed </p>
        <p>You will need physical access to your Luna SA when first setting up Remote PED, because the Remote PED vector must be created by the HSM and imprinted on a blank PED Key, or it must be acquired from a previously imprinted orange PED&#160;Key and stored in the HSM. Thereafter, the orange PED Key is used with the Remote PED from a remote location, and the connection is secured by having the matching Remote PED&#160;vector at both the HSM and the Remote PED server (your remote workstation with Remote PED&#160;attached).</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>If you encounter timeout problems (possible if you are using M of N with many keys, or if you are reading instructions as you go, or are otherwise not speedy while following prompts), you can adjust timeout values to allow for a more relaxed pace. For PedServer.exe, you can do:<br />pedserver -mode config set -socketreadrsptimeout &lt;seconds&gt;<br />but you would also need to increase the timeout in the crystoki.ini client software configuration file. Moreover, the PEDServer -socketreadrsptimeout must always be larger than the timeout in the configuration file.&#160;</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>In general, do not change settings (especially in the crystoki.ini file) unless you have good reason to do so, or are instructed to do so, by SafeNet Customer Support.</p>

</span><br />(At this time, go to the Luna PED and respond to the prompts by providing either a "fresh" orange PED key (which prompts creation and imprinting of a new/unique RPV) or an already-imprinted orange PED Key (which prompts the PED to ask you to reuse the existing PED&#160;Key data), along with additional blanks if you intend to make duplicates.)<br style="font-family: monospace;" /><span class="expandtext"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The PED says:</span><br /><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-message_set-rpv_like-to-reuse_320x314.png" style="width: 320;height: 314;" /><br /> <br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If this is the first RPV that you are creating, then answer [NO].</span><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If you have an existing RPV on an orange PED Key, then answer [YES] if you want to preserve it and add it to this current HSM, or [No] if you have made a mistake and wish to find a different blank (or outdated) key to imprint.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For this example, we will assume no existing RPV. </span><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The PED says:</span><br /><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-message_set-rpv_m_val_322x316.png" style="width: 322;height: 316;" /><br /><br />If you wish to split the RPV secret over several RPKs, for MofN split-knowledge, multi-person access control of the Remote PED function, then input a value for M that is greater than "1". This is the number of persons - each holding an orange key containing a split of the RPV secret - who must come together and present their portions whenever the RPK is required. If you prefer not to invoke MofN, then press [ 1 ], followed by [Enter].<br /><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-message_set-rpv_n_val_324x318.png" style="width: 324;height: 318;" /><br /><br />If you have invoked MofN with an M value greater than "1", then you must enter a value for N that is equal to, or greater than, M. N is the total pool of orange keys over which your RPV will be split, from which sub-groups of quantity M will be required for authentication. The simplest scheme is to declare a value for M that gives you the desired security oversight of the Remote PED function, and then specify N slightly larger so that you can always have at least quantity M key-holders available, even when some are absent for vacation, travel, illness or other reasons. Example: M=3, N=5, where any 3 of the total 5 splits can combine to reconstitute the secret.<br /><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-message_set-rpv_insert-a-rpk-key_334x329.png" style="width: 334;height: 329;" /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Do as prompted, inserting an unused PED Key into the PED's key slot (top-right of the PED), and press [ENTER].</span><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For a fresh, new, never-before imprinted PED Key, the PED&#160;says:</span><br /><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-message_set-rpv_warn_blank_overwrite_337x333.png" style="width: 337;height: 333;" /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Answer [YES] so that the HSM can create an RPV and transfer it to the PED, where it is imprinted onto the blank PED Key that you have inserted. If you invoked M of N, then the PED&#160;will prompt you to continue inserting orange PED&#160;Keys for imprinting with portions of the secret until you have imprinted quantity N of them. <br /></span><br /><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-message_set-rpv_enter_ped-pin_336x329.png" style="width: 336;height: 329;" /><br /><br />If you need two-part security to protect the Remote PED function, and wish to add a "something you know"&#160;component to the "something you have" (physical PED Key), type a series of digits on the keypad, then type them again to confirm. Now, whenever you are prompted to present the orange RPK, you must also input the code - called a PED&#160;PIN - that you have just added. The secret that unlocks the HSM to perform Remote PED operation is now a combination of a data secret contained in the physical key, and a typed-in numeric code that you must remember.<br /><br />Press [Enter] with no digits, if you do not wish an additional "something you know" secret attached to this PED Key. In future, Luna PED&#160;will nevertheless prompt you for a PED PIN whenever you present the RPK, but you will always just press [Enter] (with no digits) at that prompt - no PED PIN required.<br /><br />This completes the imprinting of the key (or keys if you opted for MofN).<br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">While the imprinted orange PED&#160;Key is still in the PED's slot, Luna PED then wants to know if you intend to make some copies of the currently-inserted PED Key (that now carries the RPV for the HSM) or group of PED Keys:</span><br /><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-message_set-rpv_are-you-duplicating_327x326.png" style="width: 327;height: 326;" /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Answer [YES] if you wish to make copies, and follow the instructions to insert keys and press ENTER. Respond to the prompts about overwriting, and PED PIN, etc.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">When you have made all the copies that you wish,  respond [NO] to the final prompt.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Control is returned to the lunash command line.</span><br /><br />Ped Client Version 1.0.0 (10000)

Therefore, the PED displays a message:<br style="color: #f39108;" /><span style="font-family: monospace;">&#160;&#160;** WARNING **</span><br style="font-family: monospace;color: #f39108;" /><span style="font-family: monospace;">&#160;&#160;Exiting now will</span><br style="font-family: monospace;color: #f39108;" /><span style="font-family: monospace;">&#160;&#160;invalidate the RPK.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;color: #f39108;" /><span style="font-family: monospace;">&#160;&#160;Confirm ?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;YES/NO</span><br style="color: #f39108;" />If you press [YES], the RPK-validated Remote PED&#160;session is dropped and must be re-established from the HSM (with "<span style="font-family: monospace;">hsm ped connect &lt;network-target&gt;</span>" before you can resume activity with the Remote PED.<br style="color: #f39108;" />In other words, if you want to use that PED&#160;for any other purpose than the current connection with one remote HSM, you have to drop the current session to make such other use of the PED, and then have the appropriate RPK available when you are ready to re-establish the prior Remote PED connection.&#160;&#160;)</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span> The above note talks about a "session" that exists only between the Remote PED and the computer (actually the PedServer software running on that computer) to which the Remote PED&#160;is connected. That is separate from the session that was established between the distant appliance/HSM and the PedServer on your computer. The session between computer and HSM is time-sensitive - it is in existence while needed and is either dropped intentionally or times out after brief inactivity. The session between the Remote PED&#160;and its attached computer persists until you disconnect the PED or change modes, or until you stop the PedServer.exe process on the computer.&#160;&#160;)</p>

Migration of PED Keys from DataKeys to iKeys must be done locally. &#160;)</p>
