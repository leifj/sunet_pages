        <p>These instructions assume that you have already acquired the Luna Client software, either on CD/DVD or in the form of a downloaded .tar archive.</p>
        <p>Applicability to specific versions of AIX is summarized in the Customer Release Notes for the current release.</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>Before 
 installing a Luna® 
 system, you should confirm that the product you have received is in factory 
 condition and has not been tampered with in transit. &#160;Refer 
 to the Content Sheet included with your product shipment. &#160;If 
 you have any questions about the condition of the product that you have 
 received, please contact SafeNet Support (800)545 6608 or support@safenet-inc.com 
 immediately</p>
        <p>Each computer that connects to the Luna HSM appliance as a Client must have the 
 cryptoki library, the vtl client shell and other utilities and supporting 
 files installed. &#160;<br />Each computer that contains, or is connected to a Luna&#160;G5 or a Luna&#160;PCI-E HSM must have the cryptoki library and other utilities and supporting files installed. &#160;</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>This example shows all the Luna Client products and components. Some items are not supported on all operating systems and therefore do not appear as you proceed through the installation script.</p>
        <p class="caution_note"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Do not install Luna client software 
 on the same system as legacy Luna&#160;CA<sup>3</sup>, Luna CA4, Luna PCM, or Luna PCI software.<br /><br />The software is intended for modern/current Luna HSMs, Luna&#160;SA, Luna&#160;PCI-E, Luna&#160;G5, Luna&#160;(Remote) Backup HSM.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>Before starting the installation, ensure that you have satisfied the following prerequisites:</p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="1."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">1.</span></span>Ensure that you have a Random Number Generator 
 (RNG) or Entropy Gathering Daemon (EGD) on your system 
 at one of /dev/egd-pool, /etc/egd-pool, /etc/entropy, or /var/run/egd-pool. 
 <div data-mc-target-name="t1"><h3>RNG/EGD</h3><p>Cryptographic algorithms, including those that assure the security of 
 communication – such as in OpenSSL and other protocols – depend upon random 
 numbers for the creation of strong keys and certificates. A readily available 
 source of random data is the entropy that exists in complex computer processes. 
 Utilities exist for every operating system, to gather bits of system entropy 
 into a pool, which can then be used by other processes. </p><p>Windows and Linux have these installed by default. Other systems might 
 or might not. See your system administrator.</p><h3>You Need an Entropy Pool</h3><p>In the case of Luna SA, the Luna Client administration tool (vtl) expects 
 to find a source of randomness at /dev/random. If one is not found, vtl 
 fails, because the link cannot be secured from the Client end. </p><p>If your system does have an entropy pool, but the random number generator 
 (RNG) is not in the expected place, then you can create a symbolic link 
 between the actual location and one of </p><p>/dev/random, /dev/egd-pool, /etc/egd-pool, /etc/entropy, or /var/run/egd-pool. </p><p>If your system does not have an entropy gathering daemon or random number 
 generator, please direct your system administrator to install one, and 
 point it to one of the named devices. &#160;&#160;</p></div></p>
        <p class="ol1" data-mc-autonum="2."><span class="autonumber"><span class="ol1Number">2.</span></span>If you are installing the Luna PCI-E, or Luna&#160;G5, or Luna  Remote Backup HSM clients, ensure that the following items are installed:<br />- Kernel headers for build<br />-  rpm-build package<br />-  C compiler<br />- make command<br />These items are required because the driver module is built on Linux before it is installed. If one of these items is missing, the driver build will fail and the module will not get installed. </p>

        <h3>JAVA</h3>
        <p>During the installation, the script asks if you wish to install Java. If you say "yes", the Luna Java files are installed below /usr/lunasa/jsp/.In order to use Java, you must have separately installed Java (JDK&#160;or run-time environment from the vendor of your choice) onto your system. </p>
        <p>Copy the Luna Java files from their default location under /usr/lunasa/jsp/lib to the Java environment directory; example <br />/usr/jre/lib/ext</p>
        <p>The exact directory might differ depending on where you obtained your Java system, the version, and any choices that you made while installing and configuring it. </p>
        <p class="caution" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>CAUTION:</b> &#160;</span></span><b>IMPORTANT!</b>
            <br />Copy libLunaAPI.so to system lib (/usr/lib) in order to make either java5 or java6 work on AIX 6.1 64-bit client.<br /></p>
        <p>For additional Java-related information, see <a href="../../sdk/java/java.htm" class="MCXref xref "><span style="color: #6c286b;" class="mcFormatColor">"Java Interfaces"</span></a> in the <i>SDK Reference Guide</i>.</p>
        <h4>JSP Static Registration</h4>
        <p>You would choose static registration of providers if you want all applications to default to our (SafeNet) provider.</p>
        <p>Once your client has externally logged in using <span class="code">salogin</span> (see   ) in the Reference section of this document) or your own HSM-aware utility, any application would be able to use Luna product without being designed to login to the HSM Partition.</p>
        <p>Edit the java.security file located in the \jre\lib\security directory of your Java SDK/JRE 1.6.x or 1.7.x installation to read as follows:</p>
        <p class="code">security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun</p>
        <p class="code">security.provider.2=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider</p>
        <p class="code"><span style="color: #f59149;">security.provider.3=com.safenetinc.luna.provider.LunaProvider</span>
        </p>
        <p class="code">security.provider.4=com.sun.rsajca.Provider</p>
        <p class="code">security.provider.5=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE</p>
        <p class="code">security.provider.6=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider</p>
        <p>You can set our provider in first position for  efficiency if Luna HSM operations are your primary mode. However, if your application needs to perform operations not supported by the LunaProvider (secure random generation or random publickey verification, for example) then it would receive error messages from the HSM and would need to handle those gracefully before resorting to providers further down the list. We have found that having our provider in third position works well for most applications.</p>
        <p>The modifications in the "java.security" file are global, and they might result in the breaking of another application that uses the default KeyPairGenerator without logging into the Luna SA first. This consideration might argue for using dynamic registration, instead.</p>
        <h4>JSP Dynamic Registration</h4>
        <p>For your situation, you may prefer to employ dynamic registration of Providers, in order to avoid possible negative impacts on other applications running on the same machine. As well, the use of dynamic registration allows you to keep installation as straightforward as possible for your customers.</p>
        <h4>Compatibility</h4>
        <p>We formally test Luna HSMs and our Java provider with SUN JDK for all platforms except AIX, and with IBM JDK for the AIX platform. We have not had problems with OpenJDK, although it has not been part of our formal test suite. The Luna JCE provider is compliant with the JCE specification, and should work with any JVM that implements the Java language specification.</p>
        <p>Occasional problems have been encountered with respect to IBM JSSE.</p>
        <p>GNU JDK shipped with most Linux systems has historically been incomplete and not suitable.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Remove components </h3>
        <p>To uninstall the JSP component or the SDK component, you must uninstall Luna Client completely, then re-run the installation script without selecting the unwanted component(s). &#160;</p>
        <p><span class="code">sh uninstall.sh </span>
        </p>
        <h3>[Ctrl] [C] - If you interrupt the installation</h3>
        <p>Do not interrupt the installation script in progress, and ensure that your host computer is served by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). If you press [Ctrl] [C], or otherwise interrupt the installation (OS problem, power outage, other), some components will not be installed. It is not possible to resume an interrupted install process. The result of an interruption depends on where, in the process, the interruption occurred (what remained to install before the process was stopped).</p>
        <p>As long as the cryptoki RPM package is installed, any subsequent installation attempt results in refusal with the message "A version of Luna Client is already installed."</p>
        <p>If components are missing or are not working properly after an interrupted installation, or if you wish to install any additional components at a later date (following an interrupted installation, as described), you would need to uninstall everything first. If ‘sh uninstall.sh’ is unable to do it, then you must uninstall all packages manually.</p>
        <p>Because interruption of the install.sh script is not recommended, and mitigation is possible, this is considered a low-likelihood corner case, fully addressed by these comments.</p>
        <h3>After Installation</h3>
        <p class="NumberedList">When you have installed the software onto a Client,
