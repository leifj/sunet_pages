        <h2 class="pageBreak">Luna PCI-E Required Items</h2>
        <p>This section provides a list of the components you should have received with your Luna PCI-E order. The list of items you should have received depends on whether you ordered a password-authenticated Luna PCI-E or a PED-authenticated Luna PCI-E, and whether you order included a backup device, as described in the following sections:</p>
        <h3>Password-Authenticated Luna PCI-E</h3>
        <p>The following are the standard items that you should have received as your basic order for a password-authenticated Luna PCI-E:</p>
        <h4>Luna PCI-E HSM</h4>
        <p>You order should include one Luna PCI-E 7000 or Luna PCI-E 1700 HSM. Both HSM models are physically identical.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/pci_card.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Anti-Static Wrist Strap</h4>
        <p>You order should include one anti-static wrist strap. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/wrist_strap.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Software and Documentation</h4>
        <p>Your order should include a DVD case containing a Software DVD and a Documentation DVD.</p>
        <h3>PED-Authenticated Luna PCI-E</h3>
        <p>For local-only operation, where you work at the same computer that contains your Luna PCI-E HSM, you require at least a single, local-only Luna PED2. The standard Luna&#160;PED 2 is capable of local operation only.</p>
        <p>If you intend to use Remote PED functions, you will need a Luna&#160;PED&#160;2 (capable of remote or local PED operation).</p>
        <p>If you intend to backup your Luna PCI-E HSM to a Backup HSM, then you require a Luna PED2 to connect to that Backup HSM.</p>
        <p>If you intend to combine remote operation and backup, then you should have at least one remote-capable Luna PED2 (for remote connection to the Luna PCI-E HSM). For convenience you might prefer to have a second PED (which can be local-only for the Backup HSM).  It is possible to use a single Remote-capable  Luna PED2 for both connections, and to simply change modes (local or remote mode)  as needed.</p>
        <p>The following are the items that you receive when you purchase a standard Luna PED2 (local-only capable).</p>
        <p>Note that you can use SafeNet PEDs and PED Keys that you already own and use with other HSMs – PEDs of the same type and version (v2.3.0 and later) are interchangeable, and PED Keys can be used with multiple HSMs if that is appropriate in your context (the only exception is the SRK, which is specific to a single Luna PCI-E HSM). You should purchase the number you need for your own convenient operation, and for backup/standby units as your security policies might require.</p>
        <h4>Luna PED</h4>
        <p>Your order should include a PED II device. To use Luna PCI-E with Remote PED function requires a Remote Capable PED  – the standard PED does not have the Remote capability. They appear almost identical except for the words “Remote Capable” on the back, and the availability of the “Remote” menu when powered on.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>Luna Local PED  cable</h4>
        <p>Your order should include a 9-pin, Micro-D to Micro-D cable for local PED operation.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/cable_micro-d_to_micro-d_local_ped.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Luna Remote PED cable (Remote PED only)</h4>
        <p>If you ordered  a Luna remote PED, your order should include a Type A to Mini B USB cable for remote PED operation.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/cable_remote_ped.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Luna Remote PED Power Supply Kit (Remote PED only)</h4>
        <p>If you ordered  a Luna remote PED, your order should include a Luna remote PED power supply kit. The power supply is auto-sensing and includes replaceable mains plug modules for international use.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/remote_ped_power_supply.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>PED Keys and Labels</h4>
        <p>Your order should include a set of iKey PED Keys and peel-and-stick labels.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/ped-key_and_labels.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Backup Device</h3>
        <p>You can back up your selected Luna PCI-E HSM partition contents (root keys, certificates, other items) to a Luna Remote Backup HSM. The SafeNet Luna Remote Backup HSM is a backup-storage option, suitable for off-site storage, and for backing up multiple HSM partitions. The Backup HSM can backup contents of Password authenticated or of PED authenticated HSMs. It must be initialized as one or the other type before the backup operation starts.</p>
        <p>The Luna Remote Backup HSM can be connected directly to an HSM, or it can be connected to a separate computer to backup remotely located HSMs, in conjunction with Remote PED.</p>
        <p>The authentication method for external HSMs must match the authentication method for any internally installed HSM with which they are used (password or PED).</p>
        <h4>Luna Remote Backup HSM</h4>
        <p>You order may include a Luna Remote Backup HSM.</p>
