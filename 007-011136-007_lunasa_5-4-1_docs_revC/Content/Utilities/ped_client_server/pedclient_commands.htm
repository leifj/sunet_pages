        <h2> The pedclient Command</h2>
        <p>This is the syntax of the pedClient command, which includes starting and stopping of the service, and an assortment of configuration options. Specify "pedClient" at the command line, plus one of the modes, plus any option applicable to that mode. </p><pre xml:space="preserve">[root@lunaclient101360 bin]# ./pedClient
Ped Client Version 2.0.0 (20000)

        Error: You must specify a mode.

Usage: pedClient [mode] [options...]

   Explanation of the modes:

     To query if a Ped Client is currently running, and to get details about
     the Ped Client, use this command:
        pedClient -m show [ options... ]

     To shut down an existing Ped Client, use this command:
        pedClient -m stop [ options... ]

     To start the Ped Client, use this command:
        pedClient -m start [ options... ]

     To start the Ped Client for Windows service, use this command:
        pedClient -m start -winservice [ options... ]

     To create a PED ID mapping, use this command:
        pedClient -m setid [ options... ]

     To test a PED ID mapping, use this command:
        pedClient -m testid [ options... ]

     To delete a PED ID mapping, use this command:

        <p>pedClient must run on any host of an HSM that needs to be served by a Remote PED.</p>
        <p>pedClient must run on any host of a Remote Backup HSM that will be serving remote primary HSMs*. </p>
        <p>* A distant HSM that appears as a crypto slot at the host of the Backup HSM is not considered "remote" in this sense, and so the Backup HSM's host does not need RBS. This would be the case for (say) a Luna&#160;SA partition where the Remote Backup workstation is a registered client of the partition, and therefore has an NTLS link with the Luna&#160;SA appliance. In that case, a lunacm session on the Backup workstation sees the Luna&#160;SA's partition as just another "local"&#160;slot. A slot-to-slot backup operation launched by lunacm at the Backup workstation is a local operation, as is a restore operation. That client relationship implies that the Backup workstation's administrator is entrusted with the partition authentication (black PED Key, challenge secret, red PED Key) for the partition on that distant Luna SA. In many cases, that is a perfectly legitimate assumption. The partition is registered with two "clients" - one is the working, or production client that uses the partition for cryptographic operations; the other is the Backup workstation that connects with the partition only when it is time to perform backup or restore activity.</p>
        <p>If, instead, the administrator of the Remote Backup HSM was not entrusted with the authentication secrets of the distant HSM partition, then the administrator could still perform a backup, but it would proceed differently. The backup administrator could connect by SSH&#160;or RDP session to a legitimate client computer and use lunacm at that client to launch the backup. The client, already authenticated to the activated Luna&#160;SA partition would see the partition as a local slot, but would see the backup HSM and its attached Luna&#160;Remote&#160;Backup&#160;HSM only through the intermediary Remote Backup Service (rbs) running on that Backup workstation and conversing with the distant client computer by means of pedClient instances at each end. This is one version of the method used when the organization (or its customer) prefers a strict separation of roles. </p>
        <p>A variant of the RBS method might work from the other direction, with the owner of the client computer doing the work, and the owner of the administrative/backup workstation simply allowing the client to take over the admin/backup workstation for the duration of the backup-or-restore operation. In either case, RBS must reside on the computer with the Luna&#160;Remote&#160;Backup&#160;HSM attached, and pedClient must run on both. </p>
        <p>The various methods have their place, depending on your organization's structure and security protocols.</p>
