        <h2>About Luna PCI-E</h2>
        <p>The Luna HSM Customer documentation uses "Luna&#160;PCI-E" whenever it refers to either of the performance versions - Luna PCI-E 1700 or Luna PCI-E 7000, without need to specifically identify one version. Those two versions are so-named because their tested performance at repetitive RSA 1024-bit signings per second (under laboratory conditions was near one or the other of those numbers (1700 or 7000). </p>
        <p>1024-bit RSA keys are actually outdated for most applications, due to their small size. However 1024-bit RSA signing has been an industry-standard way to convey application and HSM performance for many years and will continue to be used until an industry consensus is reached for an updated indicator.</p>
        <h3>HSM Basics</h3>
        <p>An HSM is a Hardware Security Module. An HSM stores cryptographic objects (keys, certificates, etc.), creates and destroys crypto objects, and performs cryptographic operations  (encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, wrap, unwrap) using those objects within the secure physical confines of the HSM - not exposed on a computer file system. The HSM also controls access to its contents and its functions. </p>
        <p>The Luna PCI-E Cryptographic Module 
 is an HSM. Here are the basic elements common to Luna HSMs:</p>
        <h4>Volatile and non-Volatile Data Storage</h4>
        <p>Luna HSMs can contain both volatile and non-volatile 
 data: </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Non-volatile data includes identification parameters and data 
 objects (such as keys and certificates) that you wish to store for long-term 
 re-use. Those objects persist on the HSM until you explicitly destroy 
 or overwrite them.</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>Volatile data is any data that should not persist when it is 
 not in use. Volatile (or session) data disappears when the HSM loses power.</p>
        <h4>The Card</h4>
        <p>The Luna PCI-E 5 [K6] HSM card is designed to the PCIe 1.1 standard, for use in PCIe x4 slots. The HSM card can be used in larger connector slots (x16). </p>
        <p>Some x16 slots are intended by the computer motherboard manufacturer to be used for video cards, and might not work correctly with Luna PCI-E 5. The symptom is that, at startup, the system detects a card in the slot, but the card does not respond as a video card, and so the system stops booting. This could happen to any non-video PCIe card inserted in such a slot. If you encounter a problem, try another available slot. Modern motherboards tend to support PCIe 2.0 standard, which is backward compatible with 1.1, when correctly implemented. </p>
        <p>Of the three major vendors of PCI bridge chips (including the one that we used), each has known problems either of performance, compatibility, or both. Due to the variety of systems and component combinations in the market, we are unable to test with all possible platforms. At the time that this Help was written we found greater incompatibility among server systems than among desktop/workstation systems. If you encounter a problem that is not solved by moving the Luna PCI-E 5 card, contact SafeNet Technical Support -- e-mail: support@safenet-inc.com or phone 800-545-6608 (+1 410-931-7520 International). </p>
        <h4>Partition</h4>
        <p>Luna PCI-E is a versatile HSM capable of many roles. Part of that versatility is achieved by separating HSM management (the Security Officer or HSM&#160;Admin space) from HSM operation (the User or client). This is achieved by means of the HSM partition or virtual HSM within the physical HSM. </p>
        <p>The owner of the partition: </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>can see and manage the contents of the partition, and </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>can enable or disable access by client applications as desired, entirely separately from the overall HSM management performed by the SO. </p>
        <p>The SO:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span> can perform HSM updates/upgrades, </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>can modify operating parameters </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>can deal with tamper events,           </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>can create or destroy a partition, reset the authentication of an existing partition (when someone forgot his password or lost his PED&#160;Key, or someone has left the organization ... or been fired...), </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>can authorize the creation of a partition challenge secret, and </p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>can perform other global operations without ever being able to see or touch the contents of the User/Owner's partition. </p>
        <p>The roles are kept separate.</p>
        <h4>Initialization</h4>
        <p>Luna HSMs must be initialized before you can use 
 them for the first time (or after an event, like too many consecutive 
 failed login attempts on the SO account, which zeroizes the HSM). Initialization establishes several HSM parameters, 
 including identification and authentication of HSM Security Officer (SO) 
 and HSM Partition User who then have access to create and use HSM/Partition 
 objects (keys, certificates, encrypted data, etc.). Once a Luna HSM is initialized, no one can access 
 it unless they provide the passwords or keys that unlock that specific 
 HSM or Partition. Initialization is meant to be performed only 
 once on an HSM, and it erases any Authentication Data, and data or token objects 
 contained on the token. Once the HSM is in use, be sure to avoid mistakenly 
 initializing it again.</p>
        <p>You can re-initialize a Luna HSM at any time (as 
 SO). Re-initialization destroys all data on the token.</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>On the other hand, until you put Luna PCI-E into service with actual 
 production data, keys, and certificates on it, you can reinitialize it 
 and practice with a variety of optional settings, as many times as you 
 wish.</p>
        <p>Many applications from PKI and other cryptographic 
 product vendors do not include the capability to initialize a Luna HSM, 
 so SafeNet supplies the Lunacm utility program on all 
 supported platforms, to perform that function and other maintenance functions.</p>
        <p>Your Luna PCI-E Cryptographic Module or HSM is shipped in a pre-initialized state, 
 as part of the factory quality assurance process. However, in that state 
 the HSM is not associated with Security Officer [SO] or User Authentication 
 Data, and is not ready to receive or to create and store objects. You 
 must perform a one-time initialization procedure with the lunacm  
 utility before the HSM can operate with an application program.</p>
        <h4>Sessions and Authentication</h4>
        <p>When you access a Luna HSM or HSM Partition, by 
 providing the passwords (Password Authentication versions) or the PED 
 Keys (Trusted Path Authentication versions), you open a session. That 
 session remains open until you (or your application) explicitly close 
 it. </p>
        <p>Removing power from a Luna HSM immediately closes 
 all sessions and causes all volatile data to disappear. </p>
        <p class="notepad_note">Your application program might not be capable 
 of logging into Luna PCI-E, on its own. If not, then the program expects 
 to encounter the HSM already in a logged-in state. For Luna PCI-E to 
 operate with such an application, you must log into the token with the 
 lunacm  utility. Find it in your LunaPCI directory, following 
 installation. Every time you reboot your computer, you are required to 
 log into the HSM with the lunacm  utility before you can resume 
 using Luna PCI-E with your application, unless you have invoked Autoactivation.</p>

        <h3>Developing a security plan and associated procedures</h3>
        <p>Not every application environment will require rigorous security and 
 paper-trail management, with respect to HSMs and their contents. However, 
 in high-security environments where security and process auditing is mandated, 
 you might be required to refer to a history of any sensitive materials and 
 any systems associated with them -- who had access, what did they do, 
 and when did they do it. Rehearse everyday operational activities, as well as maintenance 
 and update activities (Authentication Data [password] update cycles, personnel 
 changes, backups, logging) before implementation in your live environment. 
 </p>
        <p>Have all secure physical storage sites and all the related handling 
 procedures prepared in advance. Log your receipt of the Luna hardware 
 and then log all storage and handling events thereafter. In an operational 
 environment, you should be able to refer back to a complete “paper trail” 
 – an unbroken record that tracks the existence, storage, handling, and 
 all transitions/hand-offs experienced by each token/HSM that you ever 
 use. Once you take possession, never allow yourself or your organization 
 to lose track, even briefly, of any of your HSMs. If your environment includes auditing, your security auditors will require such a record.</p>
