        <h2>About Luna G5</h2>
        <p>Your Luna G5 Cryptographic Module or HSM is shipped in a pre-initialized state, 
 as part of the factory quality assurance process. However, in that state 
 the HSM is not associated with Security Officer [SO] or User Authentication 
 Data, and is not ready to receive or to create and store objects. You 
 must perform a one-time initialization procedure with the <code>lunacm</code>  
 utility before the HSM can operate with an application program.</p>
        <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> &#160;</span></span>Initialization is meant to be performed only 
 once on an HSM, and it erases any Authentication Data, data or token objects 
 contained on the HSM. Once the HSM is in use, be sure to avoid mistakenly 
 initializing it again. On the other hand, until you put the Luna G5 into service with actual 
 production data, keys and certificates on it, you can reinitialize it 
 and practice with a variety of optional settings, as many times as you 
 wish.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Sessions and Authentication &#160;&#160;</h3>
        <p>When you access a Luna HSM or HSM Partition, by  providing the passwords (Password Authentication versions) or the PED Keys (PED Authentication versions), you open a session. That session remains open until you (or your application) explicitly close it.</p>
        <p>Removing power from a Luna HSM immediately closes all sessions and causes all volatile data to disappear.</p>
        <p class="notepad_note">Your application program might not be capable 
 of logging into the Luna G5, on its own. If not, then the program expects 
 to encounter the HSM already in a logged-in state. For the Luna G5 HSM to 
 operate with such an application, you must log into the HSM or its User partition (sometimes referred to as a "token" in some cryptography documentation and discussions) using the 
 <code>lunacm</code>  utility. Find it in your LunaClient directory, following 
 installation. Every time you reboot your computer, you are required to 
 log into the HSM with the <code>lunacm</code>  utility before you can resume 
 using the Luna G5 with your application, unless the application is Luna HSM-aware. <br /></p>
        <h3>Luna G5 as Encryption/Signing HSM or as RA HSM</h3>
        <p>The Luna G5 HSM is shipped in different configurations. The Password Authenticated 
 version can be factory configured as an Encryption and Signature HSM (token) 
 or as a Registration Authority (RA) HSM. An RA HSM has the same capabilities 
 as an Encryption and Signature HSM, with the additional ability to wrap 
 private keys off the token for use by smart cards and other applications 
 where multiple secure key generation and issuance is required.</p>
        <h3>Develop a security plan and associated procedures</h3>
        <p>Not every application environment will require rigorous security and 
 paper-trail management, with respect to HSMs and their contents. However, 
 in high-security environments where security and process auditing is mandated, 
 you may be required to refer to a history of any sensitive materials and 
 any systems associated with them -- who had access, what did they do, 
 and when. Rehearse everyday operational activities, as well as maintenance 
 and update activities (Authentication Data [password] update cycles, personnel 
 changes, backups, logging) before implementation in your live environment. 
 </p>
        <p>Have all secure physical storage sites and all the related handling 
 procedures prepared in advance. Log your receipt of the Luna hardware 
 and then log all storage and handling events thereafter. In an operational 
 environment, you should be able to refer back to a complete “paper trail” 
 – an unbroken record that tracks the existence, storage, handling, and 
 all transitions/hand-offs experienced by each HSM that you ever 
 use. Once you take possession, never allow yourself or your organization 
 to lose track, even briefly, of any of your HSMs or authentication devices (PED Keys, for PED-authenticated HSMs).</p>
        <p>If you don't know where a PED Key is, you are not in control of it. If you don't know where it has been, you cannot assert that it has not been copied. If this is ever in doubt, consider resetting or changing passwords/PED Keys. Partition authentication (password, black PED Key if applicable) can be reset with resetPw. Partition or HSM authentication can be changed with changePw. Consider exercising these options if there is any chance an HSM's authentication might have been compromised. </p>
        <p>Password integrity is as secure as your personnel choose to keep those passwords. </p>
        <p>Physical authentication devices (PED Keys) are as secure as your security policies and procedures and their enforcement. </p>
