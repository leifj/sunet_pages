        <h2><a name="kanchor1"></a><a name="kanchor2"></a>About Password Authentication</h2>
        <p>This section applies to versions of Luna HSM that control access via 
 typed text-string authentication, or passwords, at all authentication 
 levels. For Luna HSMs, this is sometimes referred to as "FIPS 140-2 Level 2" or simply "FIPS Level 2" or "FIPS 2" authentication. </p>
        <p class="notepad_note">If you &#160;received 
 a Luna PED and PED Keys, then your Luna appliance's HSM probably uses 
 Trusted Path Authentication, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">not 
 Password Authentication</span> (verify with the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">hsm 
 displayLicenses</span> command), and this page does not apply to you. 
 We also can refer to that version as "FIPS 140-2 Level 3" authentication. See "<a href="about_ped_authentication_sa.htm">About Trusted 
 Path Authentication</a>", instead.</p>
        <p>In general, there are two paths to access the Luna appliance and its 
 HSM:</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>the 
 administrative path, via SSH or via local serial link, which uses 
 the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">lunash</span> 
 command-line interface</p>
        <p class="ul1" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;•&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="ul1Bullet"><b>•</b></span></span>the 
 Client path, via SSL, by which client applications use the Luna 
 SA API to perform cryptographic functions within pre-assigned virtual 
 HSMs (called Partitions) on the Luna system.</p>
        <p>For Luna HSMs with Password Authentication, the various, layered roles are protected 
 by passwords:</p>

 perform general, appliance-level administration.</td>

 then you must further be logged in as HSM Admin (of which

 Good security practices suggest that the HSM Admin password should be 
 different from the appliance admin password. However, your corporate policies

                        <p class="Bulleted">To 
 access HSM Partitions with an application to perform cryptographic operations 
 on data, you must connect remotely via SSL (called NTLS in our implementation) as a Client (one 
 that has been registered by certificate exchange and assigned by the Partition 
 Owner to this Partition)

, 
 then pass a User-type (this is done invisibly by your client application), 
 and present the Partition Password (also done automatically by your application). 
 The password used by a Client is the same Partition Password that is used 
 by the Partition Owner for the particular Partition. What limits the scope 
 of operations that a registered, authenticated Client can perform on a 
 Partition is the fact that Partition administrative commands can be issued 
 only via <b>lunash</b>. 
 Thus, for security, Clients must not be allowed to learn the appliance 
 admin password that gives access to <b>lunash</b>.</p>

        <h3>Summary &#160;</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Objects on the HSM are encrypted by the owner of the HSM Admin space or of the User space (partition), and can be decrypted and accessed only by means of the specific secret (password) imparted by the HSM Admin or the partition User respectively.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0px;">If you cannot present the secret (the password) that encrypted the objects, then the HSM is just a secure storage device to which you have no access, and those objects might as well not exist.</p>
